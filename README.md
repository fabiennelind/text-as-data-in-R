# text-as-data-in-R

This repository contains the materials for a course 
It includes the slides, example text data sets, and R scripts `xy.Rmd`.

## Workshop Outline

Facing the massive volumes of text data that are available in digital format and
valuing their potential, over recent years social scientists have increasingly turned
to methods that rely on the support of computer power, so- called computer-assisted or automated text analysis methods. The text-as-data methods are used to draw reproducible and valid inferences or meanings from documents. As an enhancement of the more classical manual methods of content analysis, automated methods of text analysis are becoming prevalent in disciplines that are overall increasingly computationally oriented.

This course is aimed at people with some knowledge of automated text analysis who want to use this method for their thesis and/or want to deepen their expertise of the matter.

The course covers topics related to data collection, data processing, quality control, and the critical interpretation of results.
