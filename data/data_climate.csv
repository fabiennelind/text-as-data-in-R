1,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-21,WEIRD NEWS; Version:1,I'm forced to wear earplugs in my own home due to my neighbours -I want to move',"A woman has voiced her upset online after the constant 'screaming and thumping' from her neighbours brought her close to 'bawling [her] eyes out'. She's forced to wear earplugs in her own home due to children 'screaming at the top of [their] lungs all hours of the day'. While she admitted that she knows the only solution is to move house, she's unable to do so in the current financial climate. Taking to popular forum Reddit, the woman shared her frustration on a neighbour's from hell thread -a platform for stories of 'annoying neighbours'. Captioning the post, she shared her frustration: ""I shouldn't have to wear earplugs in my own house."" The woman explained: ""It mostly blocks out the screaming children, but it's then the thumping around the house that really aggravates me. ""I'm at my wit's end. I know the only way is to move but we only bought last year and will be in no way able to afford it in the current climate. ""I went on three viewings on different days, different times of the day before submitting an offer and did not hear one single peep from next door. ""And within the first week of getting the keys it's been nothing but incessant and constant screaming and thumping. She went on: ""I know, 'kids will be kids' and 'they're only playing', but I was never brought up to scream at the top of my lungs all hours of the day. ""I feel stuck, frustrated and like I want to bawl my eyes out."" Flocking to the comment section, Reddit users sympathised with the woman -and even proceeded to share 'petty' suggestions of their own. One person suggested: ""I'd invest in a blue tooth speaker and drown them out. Just on bedtime is a good time to start."" The Reddit poster replied: ""You see I'm normally extremely petty and would do something like this, however I have neighbours the other side and I don't wanna be ping them off."" Meanwhile, someone else wrote: ""Totally understand. I have to wear AirPods or earplugs pretty much 99% of the time. I'm on the second floor of a four-story building, so anything I do to retaliate will bother the lady downstairs.  ""You did your due diligence by viewing at different times. Sorry, you're going through this,"" they added. A third said: ""I feel you : The stomping and chair dragging from my upstairs neighbour are a nightmare.""  Do you have a story We want to hear it!

2,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-22,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,Whales help fight climate change -yet Japan sells their meat from vending machines',"In 1962, whale was the second most popular meat consumed in Japan with 233,000 tons sold each year. It became a common source of protein after food shortages during and following the Second World War. Today its popularity has dwindled so much that 95% of the population only rarely eat it or not at all. The lack of demand means much of the one thousand tons sold each year ends up in dog food. But despite this, the ­Japanese government, which subsidised the industry with over five billion Yen nearly £40million in 2020, wants to boost whale-meat consumption. Past efforts include putting the meat into school lunches, promotion of whale meat recipes, and a website listing the restaurants which sell it. Now in another bizarre attempt to encourage more Japanese to eat the meat, vending machines from next month will sell products including frozen red whale meat, skin, and sets of canned, cooked whale. Whaling firm Kyodo Senpaku has already started trial sales in December with a vending machine in Tokyo labelled ""whale shop"". There are plans to open 100 of them across the country. The Japanese government announced its withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission the global body that regulates whale hunting five years ago. Campaigners say it was only so they could openly carry on killing whales for profit. And they say this latest ""chilling marketing move"" is another step in trying to protect the industry and reverse the decline in whale-meat consumption in Japan. ""Only a small but influential group of politicians and whaling industry stakeholders drive the country's whaling interests,"" says the Whale and Dolphin Conservation's stop whaling campaigner Astrid Fuchs. ""This latest cynical sales ploy comes at a time when the Fisheries Agency in Japan is aiming to expand the nation's whale-catch quotas in around two years' time, and possibly increase the list of species that can be killed."" Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. They also play a significant role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Each great whale absorbs an estimated 33 tons of CO2 on average, thus playing a crucial part in the fight against climate change. Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 but Japan, Norway and Iceland have killed nearly 40,000 large whales since. Over 100,000 dolphins, small whales, and porpoises are also killed in various ­countries each year. This industry is cruel, unnecessary and must stop.  Shellfish disease fear  A disease or parasite new to UK waters may have caused the deaths of thousands of shellfish along the North East and North Yorkshire coast.  The mass die-off of marine life was witnessed on 40miles of coastline from Hartlepool to Whitby between October and December 2021.   Crustaceans washed ashore were seen ""twitching"" and displaying lethargic behaviour. Although there was no direct evidence of a disease or parasite, a new report by leading marine experts said that theory would explain this movement in the shellfish.   But it added that it was possible a combination of factors could have led to the ""unusual"" deaths. The Government had previously blamed harmful algae.

3,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-02,UK NEWS; Version:1,Activists gather to support ­'Barclays 7' women who broke windows at bank's headquarters,"Outside Southwark Crown Court in London, climate activists are gathering to support the ­""Barclays 7"" - a group of women who broke windows at the bank's headquarters. The women say they took the action to draw attention to Barclays' role as the UK and Europe's largest fossil fuel investor - and they have drawn their tactics from the suffragettes' window smashing protests of 1911 and 1912. As the crowd listens to speeches in support of the women, 78-year-old Jilly Yglesias shows me a picture on her phone of her great-aunt Gladys. ""Gladys was one of the window smashers,"" she says.  ""She was a suffragette, and she smashed the window at Asprey's on Bond Street. She was arrested and sent to Holloway Prison where she endured torture by the state - force-feeding that left her mentally and ­physically damaged. ""As her great-niece, I am here to give my support to the brave seven women who broke the windows at Barclays Bank. The bank is financing the destruction of our planet, and sometimes direct action is needed for people to listen."" Birmingham schoolteacher Gladys Mary Hazel joined the suffragettes around 1908, after hearing Emmeline Pankhurst speak. She began to take part in Women's Social and Political Union WSPU protests and was among 300 women violently attacked on November 18, 1910, a date known as ""Black Friday"". On March 1, 1912, Gladys was among suffragettes who took part in a meticulously-planned action. Well-dressed ladies, apparently window-shopping in the West End, brought out toffee hammers and rocks at an agreed time and began smashing windows at 15-minute intervals. Some stones and hammers carried slogans. Dressmaker Lillian Ball's hammer had the words: ""Better broken windows than broken promises"" inscribed on it. During the Barclays 7 action, which took place at 7am on April 7, 2021, the women wore a patch bearing the same slogan. They placed stickers on the windows of the bank in Canary Wharf reading: ""In case of climate emergency break glass"", before carefully hitting the glass with hammers and chisels. ""I smashed Asprey's windows in New Bond Street and I never enjoyed anything so much in my life,"" Gladys wrote in an unpublished memoir her family discovered after her death in 1959, at the age of 79. ""As [the policeman] had to run in the same direction as me, we went ­skidding along the pavement and I managed to break two more windows while he actually had hold of me."" She added: ""I heard the pride in my voice as I told the tea party how the judge in court had looked from the large man in the witness box to me and said: 'You say she broke two more windows after you had hold of her'"" Some 126 women were committed for trial. Reported in the Daily Mirror under the headline ""Women Terrorists of London"", a reporter described ""Amazonian hammerwomen"" taking to the streets. Records from The National Archives show Gladys was arrested at Bow Street on March 5, 1912, and on multiple other occasions from 1909-1912. The Votes for Women newspaper records her being sentenced to six months in Holloway. She took part in a hunger strike there and endured the horrors of ­force-feeding. ""A tube [was] jammed in my nose, and the doctor, thinking probably that I was stopping it, went on pushing till in the end he had to pull it out with a wrench,"" she wrote. ""We were in a new wing of iron and concrete, where every sound carried and rang, and they took about three hours over the women before me, as I was last of all. That was nerve-wracking, and I had not been prepared for the sense of outrage and violation I felt."" A new book based on her memoir, The Courage Game by Jeni Whittaker, Jilly's second cousin, tells how later during her prison term, Gladys witnessed Emily Wilding Davison, who died after being hit by King George V's horse at the 1913 derby, throwing herself down a staircase. Gladys also contemplated taking her own life. Jilly says Great Aunt Gladys would have approved of the actions of ­Rosemary Annie Webster, Cazzie Wood, Gabby Ditton, Lucy Porter, Sophie Cowen, Zoe Cohen, and one other who cannot be named for legal reasons who were found guilty of causing criminal damage to Barclays Bank but spared jail, and given suspendedsentences. Also at Southwark Crown Court was actor and activist Juliet Stevenson, and Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline - who had inspired Gladys to join the suffragettes. ""I come with my Pankhurst surname... to make the link to the suffragettes,"" Helen, also the ­granddaughter of Sylvia Pankhurst, told the gathering crowd. ""To make the link with women who over 100 years ago fought against the status quo, fought against the intransigence of those who wanted to continue business as usual... ""They used direct action because constitutional methods were getting them nowhere and they felt they had to use disruptive tactics to make a change."" She turned to the Barclays 7. ""Carol, Gabriella, Lucy, Rosemary, Sophie, Zoe - granddaughters and great-granddaughters of the spirit of the suffragettes. Sisters, I salute you."" ""The argument of the broken pane of glass,"" Emmeline Pankhurst once told WSPU members, ""is the most valuable argument in modern politics."" A century later, that argument is being repeated.

4,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-25,MONEY; Version:1,Asda makes major change to popular items as supermarket axes 'use by' labels," Asda announced a major change for over half of its popular own brand products this month. The big four supermarket said it was to remove the ""use by"" dates across a range of its own brand yoghurts and will replace them with ""Best Before"" dates instead.  ""Best before"" dates are about the quality of food, while ""use by"" dates are used to show when a product is no longer safe to eat. Asda said the packaging change would allow customers to use their own judgement to when the product is ""off"" which will help combat food waste.  The change will gradually happen over the next few weeks with customers able to see it on around 28 of its products. This includes Asda's natural yoghurt, Greek yoghurt and Extra Special strawberry and hazelnut yoghurt. Asda said the decision to change the packaging's wording comes after data from climate action group NGO Waste and Resources Action Programme Wrap revealed that a massive 50% of all yoghurt wasted from UK households comes from unopened cartons. The labelling itself has also been cited as the reason for the waste, as an additional 70% of yoghurt waste comes from households not 'eating the product in time'. The popular supermarket chain said it has conducted ""robust food safety and quality evaluations"" on all of the products it will make packaging changes too.  Asda says the 28 dairy products that have been targeted sell around 455,000 units a week.  Paul Gillow, vice president of fresh and frozen foods at Asda, said: ""We are always looking at ways we can help customers reduce food waste in the home, and with research from WRAP saying 54,000 tonnes of edible yoghurt is thrown away unnecessarily each year we are hopeful this change will both make a big difference to the environment and save customers money at the same time."" The packaging change to its yogurt products follows Asda's previous decision to remove the ""Best Before"" dates on around 250 of its fresh fruit and vegetable items in last year.  The ""Best By"" date was replaced with a new code that would be used by store staff to ""ensure quality and freshness"".  Again the decision was made to aid the prevention of food waste.  Over the last few years, several major supermarkets have done this with Tesco being one of the first back in 2018 to scrap the ""Best Before"" date on around 100 of its products.  Co-op scrapped the dates for its own brand yoghurts in April last year and in January, Morrisons announced its plans to remove ""Use By"" dates on milk and encourages customers to use a ""sniff test"" instead. The charity WRAP has frequently condemned the idea of ""Best Before"" dates on fruit and vegetables arguing that they only contribute to the climate crisis by encouraging perfectly good food to be thrown away.  Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at WRAP, said: ""WRAP is thrilled to see our partner Asda make these changes on yoghurts - which will help reduce food waste in our homes.  ""Wasting food feeds climate change and costs us money - with the average family spending £700 a year on good food which ends up in the bin.  ""Our research shows applying the appropriate date label to products like yoghurts can help reduce the amount of good food that is thrown in the bin.""

5,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-01,BOXING; Version:1,BREAKING: Andrew Tate loses latest appeal against detention in human-trafficking case,"Former kickboxing world champion Andrew Tate has lost his latest appeal against his detention in relation to an investigation into human-trafficking and organised crime. Tate and his brother Tristan have been detained in Romania since the end of January as part of an investigation into alleged human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group. They were detained for 30 days and were due for release at the end of January, but a Romanian court ruled their detention could be extended to February 27. And that extension will remain in place after the British-American brothers had their latest appeal turned down this afternoon. Tate, 36, a British-US citizen who has nearly five million followers on Twitter, arrived at the Bucharest Court of Appeal on Wednesday morning handcuffed to his brother, 34.  After cultivating an image as stylish playboys during their days as social media celebrities, the pair looked noticeably disheveled as they entered the courtroom. As he left several hours later, Tate said: ""Ask them for evidence and they will give you none, because it doesn't exist. You'll find out the truth of this case soon.""  Tristan, a former European kickboxing champion and also a big name on social media, is held in the same case along with two Romanian women. All four, who were initially detained in Bucharest in late December, will look to overturn a judge's January 20 decision to extend for a second time their detention by 30 days at the request of prosecutors. They previously lost an appeal against an earlier extension. It had been determined during their last hearing that the brothers will remain in custody until February 27 as prosecutors continue investigating the case. Tate, who has lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. He has insisted there is ""zero evidence"" against him in the case and alleged it is instead a political attack to silence him. ""My case is not criminal, it's political. It's not about justice or fairness. It's about attacking my influence on the world,"" read a post that appeared on his Twitter account on Sunday. An online petition launched in January to free the brothers has garnered nearly 100,000 signatures. Fans have also protested the arrest in many major European cities, with large crowds gathering to spread their ""Free Top G"" message, referencing Andrew's infamous online nickname. After the Tates and the two women were arrested, Romania's anti-organised crime agency, DIICOT, said in a statement that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"" and were sexually exploited by the members of the alleged crime group. The agency said victims were lured with pretences of love, and later intimidated, kept under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for substantial financial gains. Earlier in January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest where they towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a blue Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche. They reported seizing assets worth an estimated 3.9 million dollars £3.1 million. Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims. Tate also unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure. Right before his arrest, Tate had found himself in a Twitter feud with Greta Thunberg after sending a mocking tweet to the 19-year-old climate activist. Her responses to the former fighter both garnered enough likes within just days to land in the most liked posts in the site's history.

6,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-31,BOXING; Version:1,Canelo Alvarez reopens door to Oleksandr Usyk fight despite Tyson Fury talks,"Canelo Alvarez's promoter Eddie Hearn has once again stated the Mexican is open to a fight with Oleksandr Usyk.  Alvarez has not fought since retaining his 168lb titles with a trilogy win over Gennady Golovkin last year, but is expected to be making a return in May. The Mexican wants to continue taking the biggest challenges, which includes a revenge bid against Dmitry Bivol who he lost to when stepping up to 175lb in May last year.  In previous conversations, Alvarez has even teased a move one higher to cruiserweight with a fight against current heavyweight Usyk seen as the biggest to make it at 200lb. And in a fresh update on Canelo's next career move, Matchroom Boxing's Hearn has claimed he joked with Alvarez about beating Usyk after he recently scored a rematch win over Anthony Joshua.   ""Never have I got the impression - never have I even doubted - that there is one fighter that he wouldn't fight,"" Hearn told the DAZN Boxing Show when talking up a clash with Usyk. ""I feel like because of what Canelo's given to the sport and because of the risks he's taken, because of the fight's he's been involved with, I think he genuinely wants these champions to do the same and go down the same route.  ""People like David Benavidez, for me, needs to make a statement to make a fight. Everything is 'no problem, no problem.' After Usyk beat AJ, you know, I was kind of joking with him - 'no problem, I'll fight Usyk.' Whether you think he's made or you think he has a chance, with all due respect he would genuinely fight Usyk at cruiserweight. He fought Bivol at 175. He would have no problem fighting Benavidez at 160.""  A fight with Usyk seems unlikely in the current climate with the Ukrainian chasing undisputed glory in the blue-riband division. It looks set that he will next face Tyson Fury to earn the final belt, at which point he could elect to retire from the sport or accept further mandatory challenges if he wins.   Would you like to see Oleksandr Usyk face Canelo Alvarez Let us know in the comments section below   However the 36-year-old previously teased a Oleksandr Usyk drops Canelo Alvarez fight hint after detailing weight struggle, where he previously reigned as undisputed king, due to the physical demands to remain at heavyweight. ""I was thinking about returning to cruiserweight and getting a few more of the world belts,"" Usyk told Parimatch.""You know, being a heavyweight means you have to be really heavy. You must eat a lot.  ""It's not hard to fight with these giants, but it's really hard to eat all the time. ""And now I work much more than I did as a cruiserweight, particularly in the training camps. I had to swim ten kilometres and train hard. At this moment I just want to stop and take a rest. A half of a year of training is hard work.""

7,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-27,CELEBRITY NEWS; Version:1,Caprice claims Prince Harry and Meghan make her 'want to vomit' in scathing rant," Caprice Bourret hasn't minced her words as she unleashed a scathing rant against Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.  The model, 51, has never shied away from sharing what is really on her mind and is no stranger to commenting on the King's son and his wife. Now, the mum-of-two has lashed out at the pair who stepped down from their roles as senior working royals in January 2020 in order to live a more private and financially dependent lifestyle. But since then, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have given several bombshell interviews, with Harry making a series of allegations about his family - including the King and Prince of Wales. In a clip from the On a Mission Podcast with Ellie McKay, shared exclusively with The Mirror, Caprice didn't hold back as she reflected on Harry's allegations. She fumed: ""I didn't have a blessed upbringing, don't play the whole victim thing, like the whole Harry and Meghan thing -argh, I just want to vomit. ""Get your finger out of your backside mate, you know And stop, be appreciative."" Caprice continued: ""Why does he keep harping on about the negatives, what about the positives too  ""The power that he had to really make a significant difference and change in the world - practise what you preach, otherwise he Harry will l lose it any public support."" But Caprice couldn't help but gush as she praised the King and Prince William following the accession in September after the death of the late Queen Elizabeth. She said: ""The Royal Family is the most powerful family in the world.  ""I think Charles, William and Kate are really trying to create a significant change with climate and health awareness. ""Look at what they are doing now, they aren't just walking around with their Royal tiaras - they are amazing."" Caprice previously claimed that Harry would end up getting bored of living in ""superficial"" California surrounded by countless A-list celebrities. She told OK! Magazine: ""He's over in LA where the only way he can make money or be relevant is ratting on his family, which is absolutely vile and disgusting. ""I think LA is a great lifestyle, but it's very different, when I moved out there for two years as an adult in the entertainment industry, I loved it initially, and then my soul was being eaten alive because it's soulless,"" later adding that people are ""self-obsessed"" and Harry will ""get sick of it.""

8,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-25,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,City experiencing brutal -53C cold snap which leads to frostbite in just minutes,"A Chinese city is experiencing a brutal cold snap with temperatures dipping to record-breaking levels as low as a bone-chilling -53C. Close to the Russian border, Mohe in China is not a stranger to cold climes with its subarctic climate and winter period usually lasting eight months. But the cold spell over the weekend was particularly exceptional, beating its previous record by a degree.  The town is known as ""China's North Pole"" and China Daily says the city is regarded as the coldest in China. In a bid to prove just how cold it is, one local reporter cracked an egg onto a shovel outside -and it immediately froze. Unsurprisingly, authorities have warned people not to go outside. In neighbouring Russia, the city of Yakutsk, which is the world's coldest city, saw temperatures plunge to minus 62.7°C, which was the coldest in more than two decades. The whole Asian region has been battling the temperatures and Afghanistan has had over 140 deaths due to the taxing conditions.  In 2019, China's ""North Pole"" attracted lots of tourists to its snow marathon.  Participants pictured with frozen eyebrows and beards ran on snow-covered high-altitude mountains during a marathon held on snowfields in Genhe city of Inner Mongolia.  Beijing News reported that coal consumption has increased by a third in the city, as the cold weather takes its toll and residents desperately try to heat their homes with open fires. Car companies also told the paper they had taken advantage of the cold to test the braking performance of vehicles. A tourist, surnamed Li, told Beijing News that he had made a special trip from China's southernmost province, Guangdong, to experience the extreme weather. ""I didn't expect it to get below -50C this year, it was quite a surprise,"" he told the paper. Other locations in China, including Huzhong at -49.8 Celsius and Tahe at -47.9 Celsius -also breaking records. South Korea's capital recorded -16C on Tuesday and northern and western Japan may see heavy snow on Thursday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. ""Japan will experience a dangerous chill along with heavy snow from Tuesday to Thursday,"" tweeted Sayaka Mori, a broadcast meteorologist. He continued: ""There are threats of frozen pipes, slippery roads, and traffic disruptions over much of the nation.""  At -20C it takes around half an hour to develop frostbite, however when it's as low as -50C, the difference becomes ""painful"" and frostbite occurs in just 2-5 minutes, Dr Watzl told ABC News.

9,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-31,POLITICS; Version:1,Coastal communities living in terror with £600m of homes in danger of plunging into sea," Coastal communities are living in fear that every new storm could be the one that will send their home plummeting into the sea. Erosion accelerated by global warming could wipe out £600million worth of coastal homes in 21 communities in England by the end of the century, a climate action group warns. Many residents do not know a decision has been taken not to build new sea defences in their area, meaning homes will be left at the mercy of the waves. Over a third of England's coastline has a designation of ""no active intervention"" under the Environment Agency's ­shoreline management plans, according to action group One Home. Yet new developments can continue to be built in these areas, potentially increasing the number of at-risk homes. Some people could even be forced to pay thousands of pounds towards the cost of demolishing their own home if it is threatened by erosion, possibly while still paying their mortgage. One Home has produced a map showing the most at-risk areas and those that will not be fortified. Chief Angela Terry said: ""Sea levels are rising as global temperatures soar and so larger waves batter our coast during severe storms. ""These irreversible changes mean some cliff faces are crumbling fast. ""We can't turn the tide or build a wall around the entire coast, so we urgently need to help seaside communities to prepare for the damage that will come."" The north Norfolk villages of Bacton, Walcott and Ostend will be worst hit, with 412 properties expected to be lost by 2100, with another 135 homes at risk a few miles south in Hemsby. Along the coast around Hollym, East Yorks, 306 homes are at risk. Communities in Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Essex, the Isle of Wight, Kent, Northumberland and Sussex will also be affected. No compensation scheme exists for those whose homes are threatened, Angela warned. Demolition grants up to £6,000 are available for those whose homes cannot be saved, but costs above this must be met by the owner. Angela added: ""Shoreline management plans are publicly available ­documents but most people are unaware of their existence. Many homeowners don't know their properties are at risk or that decisions have been made about whether to protect them or not. ""But they are not statutory, so new developments can continue. Funding is not guaranteed, so even where ­communities have been chosen to be saved, the money might not be there."" The threat to homes is taking its toll on residents, said Ian Brennan of the Save Hemsby Coastline charity, set up 10 years ago when a storm surge claimed homes in the Norfolk community. He said: ""People here are very nervous. Every time there's a storm those who live within sight and sound of the sea fear it will be the one that means they lose their home. It takes a huge toll on mental health."" The group is seeking permission and funding for rock berm defences, estimated to cost at least £5million. Ian said: ""It will buy time to allow people to adapt their lives."" In Thorpeness, Suffolk, TV producer Lucy Ansbro, 54, has spent £500,000 protecting her home from erosion. She said her neighbour's £2m house was demolished in October as receding cliffs made it unsafe.  She added: ""I was aware there was a threat of erosion when I bought this house in 2009. However, the worst-case scenario predicted losing five metres to the sea within 50 years - but, in fact, I lost five metres in 2020 alone."" The Environment Agency said: ""From 2015 to 2021, we invested £1.2billion to better protect around 200,000 homes from coastal erosion and sea flooding. ""However, climate change means that our coast is changing at an accelerated rate, meaning in some places we and coastal authorities will need to help local communities adapt and transition away from the current coastline.""

10,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-25,POLITICS; Version:1,Complaints against Dominic Raab more than TRIPLE to 24 in bullying investigation,"Dominic Raab is facing at least 24 formal complaints against him -triple the number originally thought, it has been reported this evening. Downing Street confirmed last month the Deputy Prime Minister was being investigated over eight complaints about his conduct. However, the claim suggests the bullying investigation could be much bigger than first thought. The Guardian reported sources saying the number of complainants is thought to be at least two dozen and could be more than 30.  It is a huge blow to the Prime Minister who is already facing pressure to sack Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi.   Labour called for Mr Sunak to ""come clean"" on what he knew about the allegations when he appointed Mr Raab to his Cabinet.  The Prime Minister personally read parts of the written statements submitted in the initial complaints, it is reported.  He tasked Lawyer Adam Tolley KC with looking into incidents during Mr Raab's stints as Justice Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Brexit Secretary.  The fresh claims from civil servants include that Mr Raab ""belittled and demeaned"" them and was ""very rude and aggressive"" on multiple occasions each day. Other reports include people being physically sick before meetings, regularly being in tears and being left feeling suicidal due to his behaviour. The inquiry, which is due to come to a close within a few weeks, places further pressure on Mr Sunak's promise for a premiership of ""integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level"". The Mirror revealed in November Mr Raab has been nicknamed ""The Incinerator"" because he ""burns through"" staff so quickly. Officials working for him accused him of creating a ""climate of fear"" in the Ministry of Justice.  Mr Raab was ousted from the department when Liz Truss became PM, but he returned just seven weeks later when Mr Sunak entered No10 last month.  Government sources said concerns had been raised about the turnover of staff in roles working closely with the minister.  Shadow Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: ""These shocking claims of widespread bullying and intimidation raise yet more questions about the Prime Minister's judgement.   ""He promised a government of integrity and claimed zero tolerance for bullying, yet he not only appointed Dominic Raab as his Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary but continues to prop him up.  ""The Cabinet he appointed is awash with sleaze and scandal, but the Prime Minister is too weak to do anything about it. There must be no whitewash, and the Prime Minister himself must come clean on what he knew when he reappointed Dominic Raab."" An MoJ spokesman said: ""There is zero tolerance for bullying across the civil service. The deputy prime minister leads a professional department, driving forward major reforms, where civil servants are valued and the level of ambition is high. ""There is an independent investigation under way and it would be inappropriate to comment further on issues relating to it until it is completed.""

11,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-27,UK NEWS; Version:1,"Controversial school's £4,500 Cambodia student trip has parents all asking the same thing","A school has left parents in total confusion after offering its students an exotic four-week excursion to Cambodia -for £4,500. Controversial South Wigston High School, which isn't private, has set an eye-watering price tag for the trip. According to an email sent out by the Leicestershire school, those lucky enough to go will be able to try scuba-diving, visit Cambodia's two largest cities and get stuck in with community projects. But the cost has left mums and dads suggesting only the most wealthy people would be able to afford it, reports LeicestershireLive.  The school, which hit the headlines after Parents slam school for putting daughters into ISOLATION as their 'skirts are too short' because their skirts were too short, insists students will be offered support in their efforts to raise funds to pay for their tickets. But that hasn't stopped questions being asked with the country coping with the Cost of Living crisis.  Responding to a post on a local Facebook page, one person exclaimed: ""How can they think anyone in this current climate can afford that""  While a second added: ""I feel bad for parents having to explain to their excited child that they cannot go because of how much it is. ""Kids aren't stupid but they're kids and will obviously go home excited to go away with their mates. Madness for the schools to put parents and kids under pressure like that when there are decent places in the UK to visit."" Others spent time remembering their own school days where schools trips took place closer to home - or, if they were lucky, included a short hop over the Channel. One remembered: ""I think my secondary school went camping in the Derbyshire Dales. It was brilliant. I remember making beef paste sandwiches, and the woodwork teacher me round the head for not spreading it to all the corners. I have very fond memories of the week away."" However, one parent was quick to note the potential benefits of the trip. They said: ""Four weeks child-free, why didn't I send my child to this school"" The email to parents added that children were encouraged to raise funds and there would be support for this.  Another commenter picked up on that, adding: ""Expensive yes, but what a great experience if you can afford it. If they fundraise and you save towards it, I think it's an awesome opportunity."" A spokesperson for the school said: ""This is an external company running the trip and we are one of at least 17 schools in area that advertise this opportunity to pupils.  ""Camps International have taken over 30,000 young people on 'once in a lifetime' expeditions. ""As explained in the letter to parents, pupils are supported by Camps International to fund raise over two years to cover the cost of the trip, making trips equally accessible to children of all backgrounds.""

12,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-29,UK NEWS; Version:1,Disposable vapes found strewn across beaches and beauty spots are 'environmental menace'," Disposable vapes are the latest environmental menace and have been found strewn across beaches, beauty spots and ­pavements.  Booming in popularity, especially among those aged 18-34, they are easy to use and cheap, typically costing just a few pounds for around 600 puffs - equivalent to a pack of 20 cigarettes. Because they contain ­valuable materials such as lithium batteries and copper, as well as plastic, vapes are classed as Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Users are supposed to dispose of them at a household recycling centre or at the shop where they bought the device. But they are not straightforward to recycle. If damaged when thrown away, lithium batteries can cause fires at waste disposal plants. Half-a-billion vapes are bought each year in the UK, with more than half thrown directly in the bin. That's 10 tons of lithium - equivalent to 1,200 electric vehicle batteries. Millions more are dumped on the streets. It has led to campaigners like Laura Young to call for a ban. Laura, a PhD student and climate activist, collects discarded vapes littering her hometown of Dundee. ""I think people are unaware of just what is inside a disposable vape. They are shocked to find out there is a battery inside,"" she said. The Scottish Government is now considering a ban, and in Ireland, a consultation is under way. Scott Butler, from Material Focus, a not-for-profit ­organisation focusing on recycling e-waste, said: ""Throwing away vapes means that we are throwing away some of the most precious materials on our planet. A key part of the problem is that some vapes are advertised as disposable.  ""Producers and retailers need to work together to ensure people are aware vapes should never be binned and instead be recycled.  ""Recycling needs to be made easier by the adding of collection points in-store.""

13,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-24,MONEY; Version:1,Drivers could save £800 on energy bills by selling power from their electric car,"Electric vehicle EV drivers may be able to shave hundreds of pounds off their energy bills through a new trial.  The idea is that Brits will be able to charge their car using cheaper off-peak energy. They could then use this surplus energy to either power their home at peak times, or sell the power back to the National Grid. The big players involved in the new Vehicle-to-Everything V2X trial are OVO Energy, Volkswagen UK and smart energy company Indra. Ovo ran a limited trial from 2020 until 2022, and some users managed to save up to £800 a year on energy bills.  The scheme is currently only open to Ovo customers who own Volkswagen electric cars. Drivers also need a special ""bi-directional"" charger -which effectively lets power flow two ways -to take part in the trial. These can cost thousands of pounds -This is Money claims there are some selling online for just under £6,000. It isn't clear if households will have to pay for this charger themselves as part of the next Ovo Energy trial, which launched on January 21. If drivers have to fork out the cost of the charger themselves, then this could potentially mean it would take years to claw any money back. Ovo Energy said it ""won't share final details"" at the moment about who will pay for the charger. Regardless, the scheme is being praised, with many -including ministers -saying that the UK needs a ""new network infrastructure"" in place for EVs. Energy and Climate Minister Graham Stuart said: ""We want to make smart charging an easier choice for drivers of EVs, whether that is charging on the driveway, at the workplace, or parked on the street.  ""To do that we need to build new network infrastructure at pace, using the latest available technologies."" Alex Thwaites, Head of Zero Carbon Living at OVO Energy, said: ""OVO has been leading the way in supporting customers to transition to electric vehicles and bring them on the journey to zero carbon living through exciting new products and offerings.  ""This is not just about driving renewable energy solutions forward, it's about demonstrating how customers can actually reduce their energy bills by making the switch to an EV.  ""With OVO's V2G tariff trial we saw some EV drivers save up to £800 a year on their bills."" Scott Neuman, Chief Executive Officer at Kaluza, added: ""V2X will have a transformative effect on decarbonising our energy system but only if we make it accessible and affordable for all."" The scheme is currently only open to Ovo customers who own Volkswagen electric cars, but the energy firm hopes to expand it to owners of other car firms in the future.

14,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-21,ROYALS; Version:3,Eco-conscious Harry and Meghan get gas-guzzling new Range Rover as 'Spare' sales soar," Harry and Meghan's security have been spotted in a new £119,000 motor since the release of his memoir - fittingly called a Range Rover Autobiography. It is understood the Duke and Duchess took delivery of the car to get around in upmarket Montecito, California. A member of their security detail was seen using it to run errands before filling up with fuel earlier this week. Harry's brother William, described in his book as his arch-nemesis, was seen climbing out of the same model at the 1st Battalion Irish Guards' St Patrick's Day Parade in Ireland in 2022. But eco-conscious Harry and Meghan may be concerned that the car has CO2 emissions of 207g/km - double the recommended guidelines of 95g/km. California rules also say cars should get 54.5 miles to the gallon by next year - but estimates suggest it will fall short by almost 20 miles per gallon. The arrival of the aptly named car comes as it was revealed Harry's memoir, Spare, sold almost half a million print copies in the UK in its first week on sale, the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever. Publisher Penguin Random House said the book had sold 750,000 copies in the UK across all formats - including hardbacks, ebooks and audiobooks. Harry, 38, has been vocal in raising awareness of climate change for several years. He spoke about it at the United Nations last year and founded Travalyst, a service promoting sustainable tourism. But he and wife Meghan have been repeatedly branded hypocrites for using private jets. In September 2021 they reportedly used one to fly home from New York - after a concert urging action on climate change and extreme poverty. And research that offset activities considered eco-positive against their travel footprint branded them the least eco-friendly royals for 2019-20.

15,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-01,TRAVEL NEWS; Version:1,Eight of the most remote and beautiful but brutal jobs if you want to leave it all behind,"Could you leave it all behind to lead a dog patrol on the brutal Greenland ice shelf or observe birds on one of the world's most isolated islands Since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in the UK, a far higher chunk of the population are working remotely than ever before. Some have taken advantage of the flexibility their jobs now afford them, moving away from the hub-bub to the beautiful Scottish highlands while holding down a desk-job in London. As life-changing as such a move may be, it is small fry when it comes to some of the most intensely remote jobs out there.  StaySafeApp has compiled a list of the most extreme living and working conditions across the Globe, where often people work alone, have to survive all weather conditions and have little contact with the outside world.  Each location is ranked by how far it is from a developed town or city, how accessible the location is and the nature of the work.  Sirius Dog Patrol, Greenland   A dedicated unit of the Danish Special Forces Command, primarily patrolling the world's largest national park, Greenland's vast and unforgiving border, the Sirus Dog Patrol is a job not for the fainthearted.  Only the most elite soldiers in the country make up a small team that work in the coldest and most remote regions on earth, in order to protect Denmark's security. Soldiers have to be trained in multiple skills, including dentistry and medicine, due to them not having access to these services whilst on patrol. They live in darkness during the winter months and their only access to the outside world is via Satellite telephone. Temperatures can range from -10ºC to a bone chilling -55ºC, and the nearest city is 1,002km away. Women are welcome to apply but none have yet.  Lighthouse Caretaker, Maatsuyker Island Lighthouse, Australia   Even though most lighthouses are now automatic and don't need a keeper to shine the lights anymore, there is still the important role of caretaker to ensure the lighthouse and its surroundings keep running smoothly.  The Maatsuyker Island Lighthouse in Australia is the country's most southerly and sits on a 186 hectare island, 5.5km off the coast. The island suffers from dramatic weather with 250 days of rain per year and winds up to 176km per hour. This can be a problem when the only access to the island is via helicopter flight. The caretaker job, which is open to two people, gets thousands of applicants applying every six months. In August 2019, two volunteer lighthouse caretakers became engaged to be married at the lighthouse.  Scientist, Concordia Station, Antarctica   Located 1,600km from the South pole, the French-Italian research centre, Concordia Station dubbed 'White Mars', is so remote that the European Space Agency's Mars programme used it to understand how humans react to long-term isolation.  It provides a unique platform to learn about Earth and 16 scientists live here for one year in complete isolation -this includes four months of the year in total darkness. The scientists gather relevant data to study glaciology, seismography, the Earth's magnetic field and the climate.  Plus, the cloud-free skies make Concordia an excellent site for astronomy observation. The centre is based at 3,200 metres altitude, so the crew has to live with a third less oxygen than is available at sea level. The nearest human beings are stationed some 600km away at the Russian Vostok base, making Concordia more remote than the International Space Station. All topped off with temperatures reaching minus 80 degrees and you have to really love science to take this job.  Warden, Calf of Man, Isle of Man, UK  In 1959 the Calf of Man, an island off the Isle of Man, was made a bird sanctuary, and has been looked after by two seasonal wardens ever since. The 618-acre island becomes their home and place of work from March to November, as they share a farmhouse. Their only company is sheep and seals, and a small fishing boat arrives weekly with their food and other supplies, depending on the weather. Wardens are responsible for monitoring the native birds through migration and breeding, with close attention paid to the Puffins on the island. The downsides are that they can only take showers once a week to save water, and have just two wood burning stoves to keep the wardens warm.  Marine Management Officer, Tristan da Cunha  Part of the UK overseas territory, Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic is one of the most isolated islands in the world. It is 2,400km from the nearest land and is home to 250 islanders and millions of seabirds and fascinating wildlife. The marine management officer role lasts for three years, and is responsible for a project that will engage the inhabitants and ensure long term protection of their waters and wildlife. Tasks include everything from running events with local school children, to counting penguins! It's no small task, as they'll be covering the Marine Protection Zone, an area three times the size of the UK, and the largest in the Atlantic, which is home to one of the world's most pristine marine environments and wildlife.  Fire Lookout, Gila National Forest, New Mexico  Phillip Connors quit his job at the Wall Street journal back in 2001 and has been perched on top of a 35 foot high tower looking for signs of smoke, ever since. As fire lookout, he helps alert firefighters to potential forest fires so they can tackle the blaze early. But it's not as easy as you may think, the park in New Mexico is 10,970 sq km.  It's a 8km hike from the tower to the nearest road, but Philipp stays there half of every year. The Black Fire in 2022, forced Phillip to evacuate via helicopter as he watched it creep closer for days at a time. He has also been witness to the impact of a warmer climate, and how the weather and landscapes have changed as a result.  Seafood Processor, Alaska   This job is often recommended on Reddit when someone asks what jobs they can do that are isolated.  Although it's a busy seafood processing plant, the repetitive nature of the tasks and little time for casual chat with colleagues, makes it perfect for someone who prefers solitude. Perhaps the most physically demanding job on the list, a seafood processor will find themselves on their feet up to 16 hours a day in very cold temperatures, sorting, butchering and packing away fish. You could be working seven days a week, or not at all, depending on the fish deliveries. Travel and housing costs are covered by the employer, but don't expect peak luxury, as it will more likely be dorm style rooms.  Winter Caretaker, Yellowstone National Park, USA  From December to March, the winter caretaker has to clear the snow from 100 rooftops and roads in the 8,000 sq km park. You'd be right in thinking there must be a lot of snow for that to be a fulltime job, 3.8 metres is the average but it's not uncommon for it to be twice that on the higher ground. With temperature sometimes hitting minus 22ºC, it can actually be too cold to move the snow. The caretakers use saws and shovels to push the cut blocks off the roofs. They are also responsible for maintaining other buildings like employee dorms and the trails around the park. Not as isolated as it once was, as phone signals are fairly reliable now, the caretakers do still have to plan around a twice season 110km trip to the nearest town for fresh vegetables and milk.

16,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-19,MONEY; Version:2,Energy expert shares radiator hack that'll save you hundreds on your bills,"With the soaring cost of living people around the country will be looking for ways to save on their household bills, and now an energy expert has shared a radiator hack that will save you cash. Not only will it be good for your wallet, but it will be good for the planet too -as the trick will lower your carbon footprint at the same time. Last year the UK experienced the hottest summer on record, which resulted in an extra 3,271 deaths, and experts believe the rising temperatures are a direct result of people using more fossil fuels. Now, Katy King, deputy director of sustainable future at innovation firm Nesta, has shared how you can lower your bills and your emissions -and it won't cost you a penny.  What do you think about climate change Let us know in the comments...  Katy said: ""We focus on household energy use, that's one of the biggest sources of UK carbon emissions -if you can change your energy use in your home that's the big one. ""You can turn down your thermostat by one degree -so if you go from 19 degrees to 18 degrees you can save around £150 on the average energy bill over the year. ""That would be 268kg of carbon, the equivalent of one quarter pounder beef burger a day for five months, it shows how your heating has quite a big impact on the environment. ""We've really focussed on things that are free or low cost, and you only have to do them once and then you get the savings. ""With the boiler one, you can set it and forget it, you could fit a water-efficient showerhead -then can save about £90 on how much hot water you're using, it costs about £10-20. Once you've installed it, you don't need to think about it. ""People tend to think certain actions are more effective, like turning off lights -which actually save about £25 a year. We think having to do something every day and having everyone do it, you're unlikely to make that £25 saving, but changing your shower head or lowering the thermostat you're more likely to make it as you can set it and forget it. ""You can also turn down your radiator valves, most people have a valve with one to six, or one to five, so you can turn them up and down. ""It's a little known fact that around three on that dial means your room is heated to 18-20 degrees, so if you put it to six it means it will keep heating the room to 30 degrees -turning it down can save you £70 a year. We don't recommend zero, the lowest should be one or you'll get damp or mould. ""The final thing would be draft-proofing, that's quite a broad range of things but if you can block up any drafts that's obviously a very effective way to save money -if you add a chimney draft excluder you can save £90 a year, if you seal gaps between skirting boards, that could save you £65 a year."" Nesta explained that the typical gas boiler in the average home has the same impact as seven London to New York flights per year, so turning it down can prevent a chunk of carbon emissions entering the atmosphere. The experts at Nesta, who are committed to tackling climate change, recently commissioned Cambridge Architectural Research to model the savings that can be made for free, alongside low-cost energy-saving measures. They described it as a ""triple win"" as not only would it reduce carbon emissions, but it provides energy security and reduces household bills. They found that a typical household with a combi boiler can save around £210 a year when their advice is followed, and households with a system boiler can save around £100 a year. They said that if the measures were adopted around the country, the UK would save £1 billion per year in energy costs. To make the change, all you need to do is turn down the temperature on your boiler. A spokesperson said: ""If 10 million households turned down the flow temperature on their combi boilers to 60°c or below this could wipe £1billion off UK energy bills and save 1.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions - the equivalent of nearly six million people taking transatlantic flights. ""Many combi boilers are burning more gas, generating more carbon emissions and costing households more than they need to. ""People could be saving energy and money simply by ensuring their boiler is running as efficiently as possible. But many people aren't aware they can change their boiler settings.  ""The average household could currently save around £112 per year on their heating bill by lowering their boiler flow temperature. ""Heating homes with fossil fuels accounts for 15 per cent of the UK's carbon emissions. So by using energy more efficiently, we can cut carbon emissions and save money on our heating bills at the same time. "" Climate change has been a hot topic for years and while there are deniers around the world no one can ignore the freak weather conditions that are happening on an increasingly regular basis.  A recent study by the Met Office shows that the UK reached an average temperature of 10°C, a record high that came about due to 'human induced climate change'. Dr Mark McCarthy, 45, manager of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office in Exeter, Devon, said: ""Climate change is a real and present risk. ""2022 has been the warmest year on record for the UK and also the first time that the annual average temperature of the UK has been above 10°C. ""This is part of a pattern of warming that we have been observing for the UK and our climate has warmed by about one degree since the 1960s to present, and that's consistent with the global average warming that we have witnessed as a consequence of human emission of greenhouse gasses."" Dr McCarthy explained that the Met Office has been collecting data on British weather since 1884, and using the 140 years of information and factoring in current global emissions they are able to predict what the future will have in store. He continued: ""What we can show, using a combination of the historical weather records we hold and an understanding of the science, we can quantify that greenhouse gas emissions and human-induced climate change have increased the likelihood of hitting this 10-degree threshold by 160 times, compared to a pre-industrial climate. ""In a pre-industrial climate, seeing a statistic like 2022, we estimate it would be a one in 500-year event -so not impossible, but highly highly unlikely. ""While this is the first year we have recorded this temperature, in our current climate it is likely to occur every three or four years -it's not a question of if we will break that record again, but when."" Industry expert Rupert Clark-Lowes, from Orbis Advisory, said: ""There are more resources, frameworks and consultancies out there than ever before and they are here to help to tackle this problem and the urgency for action has never been so great.  ""It's also a win-win for businesses as it's now becoming a core expectation by stakeholders for companies to measure their emissions, look at their corporate ESG strategies, understand the risks and opportunities of climate change, and have clear net zero strategies in place.  ""At Orbis Advisory we are seeing more demand for this than ever which is encouraging but, as I've always said, implementation and action needs to be a prioritised move with strong governance to ensure momentum is not lost.""

17,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-27,UK NEWS; Version:1,Five-month-old baby has '20 year smoker's cough because of mouldy home',"A five-month-old baby living in a council flat with a ""horrific"" mould problem has the cough of a smoker of 20 years, his grandmother has said.   The baby's grandmother, Nicola O'Connor, has been sending complaints to Dublin City Council since the mould in her two bedroom apartment exploded, rendering the apartment near unliveable.  Seven people across three generations are living in the city centre flat, all of whom have been on antibiotics to combat illnesses they contracted they say as a result of the damp conditions. Sinn Fein TD Irish member of parliament Chris Andrews has called on the Government to address the issue which he said needed ""direct intervention"". Frustrated grandmother Nicola O'Connor, who has been in the flat for 15 years, told Dublin Live: ""The mould got bad before Christmas. ""We only had the wallpaper up for three weeks and the whole place was destroyed. I can't even put a new floor down in the bedroom because it is so wet. It is damp there but it was never as bad as it was at Christmas. ""I treated it but the paint is still coming off the wall.""  Nicola doesn't know what made the damp so bad all of a sudden and said there ""were no works done"" recently that could have started it. ""It is absolutely shocking. It is a two bedroom flat. I've got my 28-year-old son, my 22-year-old daughter, my 12-year-old son, my eight-year-old daughter, my three-year-old grandson and five-month-old granddaughter in that room. ""I don't want a bigger place but I just want my daughter to have a bigger place. It is just that there are too many people in that room."" She added: ""The baby has a shadow on her lung. She has to go back now in another couple of weeks for an x-ray. ""My grandson has had five antibiotics since October for tonsillitis and chest infections. Both of my daughters have been on antibiotics and I've been on antibiotics and inhalers. ""It is a nightmare. There is an empty flat underneath us and we are trying to get a flat for my daughter. I've been smoking for 30 years and I don't have a cough as bad."" DCC did send out contractors to put fans in the flat, in Saint Andrews Court, but Nicola doesn't think it is enough.  ""What are fans going to do The wall needs to be treated and there is no point in putting a fan on if it is not,"" she added. A spokesman for DCC said: ""Dublin City Council does not deal with maintenance requests via the media and will not discuss specific cases for privacy reasons."" Deputy Andrews called on the Government to set aside money for the ""battle on mould"".  He said: ""The chances of the Council sorting out the mould is long gone. ""Government needs to intervene directly. Government needs to set up a task force with ring fenced funding for the battle against mould. ""Tenants in Mercer House and York street and all the flats deserve better. The climate change funds can be used for insulation to make the flats warm and modern and crucially energy efficient. ""It seems though that emissions reductions are only for the wealthy. No schemes are supporting those living in the flats.""

18,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-24,UK NEWS; Version:1,Four biggest threats to humanity as Doomsday Clock ticks CLOSER to midnight,"The Doomsday Clock, a symbol that represents the likelihood of man-made catastrophe, has changed to 90 seconds to midnight -meaning that human life has never been at more risk. With midnight marking the inevitably of doom, last year the clock remained stuck at 100 seconds to midnight -the most dangerous position since the concept began in 1947, until now. With evidence of climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and specifically the ongoing war in Ukraine, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the second hand ten seconds closer to annihilation. Their assessment is based on scientific research and they noted that new disruptive technologies were a contributing factor, but the nature of our doom is of course still a mystery to them -so we've taken a look at some issues we face today.  How close do you think we are to doom Let us know in the comments...  In 2022, inflation surged around the world plunging many into poverty, the global population spiked, and there were record-breaking heatwaves around the globe -which are scientific evidence of climate change. The Doomsday Clock is designed to act as a symbolic measure of the ""world's vulnerability to catastrophe"", and looking back on the last year it's not surprising that the clock moved forward.  War rages on  On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and since then things have gone downhill.  During the conflict, Russian forces seized Chernobyl, after intense gunfire broke out at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, sparking fears the containment equipment may become unstable.  Thankfully, the invading troops gave up the land and Chernobyl is back under Ukraine's control.  The number of Russians killed or injured has reached 188,000, according to US intelligence, it has been reported.   Vladimir Putin's forces are also said to have seen 2,000 of their tanks destroyed or captured since the invasion began, and some have likened the warfare to like that of World War I.  The new figures were shared at a Western summit on Thursday held at Ramstein Air Base in southern Germany.  Average UK temperature exceeded 10°C   A recent study by the Met Office shows that the UK reached an average temperature of 10°C, a record high that came about due to 'human induced climate change'.  Dr Mark McCarthy, 45, manager of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office in Exeter, Devon, said: ""Climate change is a real and present risk. ""2022 has been the warmest year on record for the UK and also the first time that the annual average temperature of the UK has been above 10°C.

""While this is the first year we have recorded this temperature, in our current climate it is likely to occur every three or four years -it's not a question of if we will break that record again, but when.""  World population exceeds eight billion   In November, the world's population surged past eight billion for the first time -11 years after the total hit seven billion amid an increase in longer lifespans. The hike in people poses challenges on food, water and energy resources as a peak of 10.4 billion is forecast in the 2080s. UN population expert John Wilmoth said: ""It raises questions about our impact on the world."" But the ""unprecedented growth"" is slowing and there will not be nine billion people until 2037. It comes as 37 million people face starvation in the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, after four droughts amid climate change. India is now drawing level with China, which has the biggest population of 1.4 billion, and is due to surpass it next year. In the book 8 Billion And Counting, Jennifer Sciubba says in AD1 there were 300 million people and women had four kids on average. She added those alive today ""represent about seven per cent of 108 billion who have ever taken a breath"".  Inflation surges causing economic instability  As if the increasing population wasn't enough of a problem, the current economic climate would appear to be unable to support many more people. Inflation has surged around the world, and here in the UK the cost of living is still rising at one of the highest rates in 40 years.   Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation was marginally down from 10.7 per cent in the previous month of November -and has fallen further back from a 41-year high in October.  Inflation is also still five times higher than the Bank of England target of two per cent -meaning more interest rate rises could be on the cards. The Office for National Statistics ONS said falling fuel prices helped lower CPI inflation, along with cheaper clothing and footwear. Fuel prices rose by 11.5 per cent in December 2022, down from 17.2 per cent in the year to November. Prices of clothing and footwear rose by 6.4 per cent overall during the same timeframe, easing from the 7.5 per cent recorded in the previous month. But the price of restaurants and hotels, food and non-alcoholic beverages all continued to rise. Restaurants and hotels saw an 11.4 per cent increase in December 2022, up from 10.2% in November. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by 16.9 per cent -a further rise from 16.5 per cent in the previous month.

19,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-26,EUROPE; Version:1,French ski resorts strikes -everything you need to know from key dates to refund rights," Ski holidays in February could be thrown into chaos by strikes called by two unions.  After a horrid start to the ski season on the Continent during which unseasonable warm weather caused by climate change melted usually reliable slopes, Alpine resorts are about to be dealt another blow. Two main unions covering lift and seasonal workers are planning ""unlimited"" industrial action from January 31 as part of wider protests against pension reforms in France. Walkouts are being targeted over the school half-term period which may close scores of ski stations, The Times reported. Half term in the UK is split over two weeks, from February 11 to 25, while the French equivalent runs for four weeks from February 4. Eric Becker, head of the lift operators' branch of the Force Ouvriere union, has said: ""We have decided to call for a strike during the February holidays because demands are listened to more during this period."" The other main union, Confederation Generale du Travail, issued an open-ended notice of intention to strike from February 6 to 19. Workers are walking out partly in protest at the controversial pension reforms as well as the modification of unemployment insurance schemes for seasonal workers. It is not completely clear how widespread the disruption is likely to be.  Although it has been widely reported that ""unlimited"" strike notices have been filed for the month of February and over the Ski World Cup in Méribel and Courchevel, a filed notice is not the same as a planned strike.  Only one day of action has been pencilled in so far, for January 31.  It followed a day of action on January 19, when strikes on three lift operators in Courchevel and four in Les Menuires caused limited disruption.  Olivier Desaulty, director of Les 3 Vallées, has provided a punchy prediction for how little impact he believes the strikes will have.  ""The strike was little followed and had no impact on holidaymakers,"" he told The Telegraph.  ""We respect this right to strike while maintaining quality social dialogue every day, which allows us to be optimistic for the February holidays and the World Championship."" Xavier Schouller of French mountain specialist Peak Retreats, said the strikes were ""a total non-event"" and that 95% of resorts won't even face the slightest bit of disruption.  If you do find yourself caught up in any chaos, what you should do depends on how you booked the trip.  Those who are on the slopes as part of a package deal may be moved to a different resort or be offered a refund, as per the terms and conditions of the holiday.  If you have booked independently contact your individual providers and airlines, and check your travel insurance.  As with airlines impacted by strikes, they are rarely required to pay out for disruption considered outside of their control.

20,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-05,EUROPE; Version:2,French ski slopes forced to close as climate crisis causes unseasonably warm winter," The ski season is in the midst of a crisis as half of France's slopes have had to close amid record temperatures fuelled by global heating. Alpine enthusiasts have found themselves on muddy hillside this December and January as rain and sleet combine with warm weather to melt the snow, with resorts in the northern Alps and French Pyrenees affected. Ski resort Ax 3 Domaines was forced to temporarily close, while the likes of Le Gets and Morzine have only opened a limited number of runs.  ""The period immediately after Christmas was the warmest since 1997 in France"", with ""exceptionally high"" temperatures recorded, The Local France reported. Temperatures around 8C higher than the seasonal average has devastated many of the ski resorts at a lower altitude and made winter sports impossible. Many skiers have filmed themselves standing on mud as ski lifts trundle overhead. Austrian ski resorts in the Salzburg region have had no snow for at least a month, while parts of Switzerland are 20C warmer than usual. After years of warning that temperatures in the resorts were creeping up and making skiing harder and harder, the start of 2023 seems to be the realisation of many people's worst fears. As the level of carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions continue to increase and global temperatures rapidly rise, the situation is likely to get worse year-on-year. The worsening conditions in the Alps may lead some winter sports enthusiasts to look elsewhere for a fresh piste. One country which has become increasingly popular in recent years is Bosnia, which is known for offering cut price packages in comparison to France, Italy and Switzerland. Unfortunately it is also suffering from a difficult winter due to unseasonably hot weather, leading visitors to the country to pack up and go home following New Year's celebrations at its resorts. Hotel owners say bookings are down, and with them both room prices and staffing levels. Tourism officials said holiday makers are forced to seek alternatives to skiing, like hiking on grassy mountaintops -or riding ski lifts, just for the views. ""Right now, when we should be welcoming skiers on our mountain, we have no snow so there is no doubt that our business will falter, that is to be expected,"" said Dino Korugic, manager of the Sunce hotel in Vlasic. ""Our bookings correlate strongly with the weather forecast."" Record-high daily temperatures for this time of year have been beaten in recent days at hundreds of weather stations, in at least 10 countries: Bosnia, Belgium, Czechia, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland. At least five of those -Belgium, Czechia, Latvia, Poland and the Netherlands -set national record daily highs for a December 31 or January 1. The U.N.'s World Meteorological Organisation has long warned about the ill-effects of climate change, and say the last eight years have been the eight hottest on record. The fallout this winter hasn't been limited to snowless slopes, where mid-range altitudes have been affected most of all: Weather officials and scientists say flora and fauna are feeling the impact too. Meteorologist Florian Imbery of Germany's national weather service, DWD, said the temperature anomaly seen over the new year period could trigger unwanted plant growth -exposing crops to greater risk of frost damage later in the winter. Biologist Livio Rey, spokesman for the Swiss Ornithological Institute, said many ducks that would normally migrate to Switzerland this time of year from Nordic countries don't come anymore, like the tufted duck.

22,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-30,ROYALS; Version:1,Harry and Meghan publish 24-page dossier on $13m post-royal work amid staff shake-up," Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Foundation has raised $13million and given away $3million to charitable causes, it has been revealed.  The couple's charitable foundation, which was set up after they stepped down from their royal roles, has released a 24-page report detailing the causes that have been helped by money they have donated since it was founded in 2020, which include Covid vaccines and Afghan refugees.  Cash was also donated to the World Central Kitchen as well as to a project to build a playground in Uvalde, Texas, where a gun massacre took place in a school last year killing 19 children and two teachers.  It comes amid a staff shake-up at the couple's Archewell organisation, which has seen two key staff members announce they would be stepping down.  The Archewell Foundation ""impact report"" does not contain any accounts or figures on how much exactly has been donated to charities and organisations.  However, Omid Scobie, a favoured journalist of Harry and Meghan, tweeted: 'The Sussexes' Archewell Foundation has released its 2020-22 'Impact Report'.  ""In their first year of operation, they raised $ 13million and distributed $3million in grants across areas including vaccine equity, relief centres, refugee resettlement, and building better online world.""  In a breakdown in the report, Archewell, named after Harry and Meghan's son Archie, says it helped to procure 12.66million Covid vaccines for people throughout the world thanks to its partnership with Global Citizen.  It also says it helped almost 8,000 people flee Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in the summer of 2021 and dished out 50,000 meals through the World Central Kitchen following climate disasters in Puerto Rico and Dominica. The foundation also partnered with the City of Uvalde and Kaboom to create a play space for children. In the days following the massacre, Meghan visited the city to lay flowers and pay tribute to the victims.  Meanwhile, the report also says that Archwell has helped fund 13 academic fellows to ""address society's most urgent concerns surrounding social media' at Harvard's Institute for Rebooting Social Media"".  James Holt and Shauna Nep, the co-executive directors of Archewell, wrote in the report: ""Since its founding in 2020 by Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, The Archewell Foundation has built a growing body of work rooted in the philosophy of compassion, connection, and care.  ""With the leadership of The Duke and Duchess, we have cultivated strong strategic partnerships with leading organizations, invested millions of dollars across the non-profit space for sustainable programs and campaigns, and designed a strategy centred on large and lasting community impact.""  The publication of the report comes just hours after it was revealed that Fara Taylor, who is head of the Archewell Productions marketing team, and internal content head Ben Browning, would be leaving the organisation.  Both worked on Harry and Meghan's controversial Netflix docuseries and neither is being replaced.  Ashley Hansen, Archewell's head of communication, told the Telegraph that both ""exceeded expectations and made their mark within the cultural zeitgeist"".  She said Harry and Meghan were ""hugely grateful"" for their support on the ""vital look-back projects"" that they have recently released. It comes several weeks after it was announced that Mandana Dayani would be leaving her post as president of Archewell.  It is understood the couple will take on full leadership of the company, and a statement from Archewell at the time was at pains to make clear they had not fallen out. Ms Dayani, 40, had been at the helm of the couple's media and charitable empire for less than 18 months. She ran the day-to-day operations at the company and played an integral role in setting up Meghan's Spotify podcast Archetypes.

23,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-18,US CELEBRITY NEWS; Version:1,Jamie Lee Curtis leads celebrity support for Greta Thunberg as she's detained by police," Jamie Lee Curtis is among the celebrities showing their support for Greta Thunberg after the climate activist was detained by police during an environmental demonstration in Germany.   The 20-year-old travelled to western Germany to take part in a protest against the demolition of the village of Lützerath to make way for the expansion of a nearby coal mine.  During the demonstration, there were clashes with the police and Greta was one of several protesters who was carried away by authorities.  Taking to Instagram, Jamie Lee shared a picture of a news article which showed Greta being taken away.  Alongside the photo, which has gained more than 26,000 likes, the 64-year-old actress described Greta as an ""influencer"".  Rock band Garbage also threw their support behind the Swedish activist.   Taking to Twitter they wrote: ""Free Greta Thunberg.""  Author Morgan Jenkins also applauded Greta as she shared a snap of her being carried away by police. She wrote: ""Greta Thunberg's face in this image reminds me of the faces of kids who had to get hauled out of the McDonald's ball pit when they were getting too wild. ""She is unbothered."" This isn't the first time Halloween star Jamie Lee has expressed her support and admiration for Greta. Last month Greta mocked controversial online personality Andrew Tate following his arrest as part of a human trafficking and rape investigation, which stemmed from evidence of a pizza box shown in a video he aimed at her. She tweeted: ""This is what happens when you don't recycle your pizza boxes."" Jamie Lee then responded: ""Maybe there is a late night team looking for a new comedy writer. @GretaThunberg for the environment AND the win!"" A video from the protest in Germany shows dozens of police in riot gear at the event, moving in on the crowd after several activists ran over to the Garzweiler open pit mine.

24,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-12,SCIENCE; Version:1,Last eight years hottest on record as scientists warn of 'unprecedented' temperatures,"The past eight years were the warmest on record globally, according to six leading international temperature datasets.  UN scientists have said that ""stark"" data from 2022 shows that last year was another ""near-record"", coming in as the sixth warmest in records dating back to 1850. They've warned that despite the extreme temperatures we saw in 2022, the year could be ""one of the coolest years of the rest of our lives"" as global warming is fueled by ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated heat. The average global temperature last year was about 1.15C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 levels, marking the eighth consecutive year that annual global temperatures have reached at least 1C above pre-industrial levels. The likelihood of temporarily breaching the 1.5C limit of the Paris Agreement - a legally binding international treaty on climate change - is increasing with time, warns the UN's World Meteorological Organisation WMO. Last year large areas of Pakistan flooded, with major economic losses and human casualties. Record-breaking heat waves were also observed in China, Europe, North and South America.  The University of Reading has released the latest version of the now-famous ""climate stripes"" graphic which included 2022 data using Met Office figures, which inventor Professor Ed Hawkins said showed ""stark"" global warming.  Across the datasets, 2022 was assessed as being the fifth or sixth warmest year on record, despite the presence of a La Nina event - a natural climate pattern that temporarily lowers temperatures. But the WMO warned that the cooling impact was short-lived and would not reverse the long-term warming trend caused by greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere by human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Dr Colin Morice, from the Met Office, said: ""2022 was another near-record year for global average temperatures, despite the slight cooling influence of La Nina: a pattern of climate variability in the tropical Pacific that typically acts to suppress global temperatures. ""Climate variability has always imparted an influence on global temperature, making some years slightly warmer or cooler than others. ""The influence of natural variability throughout the 173-year-long observed temperature record is small compared to the ongoing warming due to human-induced climate change."" Professor Tim Osborn, of the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, said: ""Our global temperature data show that 2022 was consistent with the long-term warming of 0.2C per decade that we have observed over the last 50 years. ""Unless we can take action that slows this rate of warming, the world's climate will reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within the next 15 years."" The climate stripes, created by Prof Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, represent each year since 1850 with a consecutive vertical stripe whose colour ranges from deep blue for the coldest years to dark red for the warmest years. The stripes are a visual representation of world warming, with older years to the left of the graphic dominated by blue stripes, which changes to more recent years with darkening shades of red. He said: ""The data from 2022 is stark, however you look at it. ""Whether you view the figures in their raw form, or look at the data as another red line added to the climate stripes, the message is clear. ""Excess heat is building up across the planet at a rate unprecedented in the history of humanity."" He said 2022's stripe was the second-darkest red because of La Nina and that, as that climate pattern changed, the darkest red stripes would return. He added: ""If you think how hot 2022 was, and then realise that those 12 months will likely be one of the coolest years of the rest of our lives, I think we will regret not having acted sooner on these warnings.""

25,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-10,FORMULA 1; Version:1,Lewis Hamilton may risk F1 ban if he repeats past actions after FIA chief's clear warning," FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem hailed Formula 1 drivers as ""the stars of the show"" - but warned them saying the wrong thing could land them in hot water.   Several drivers, in recent years especially, have used their platforms to promote good causes. Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel were two of the most active in that regard, highlighting social injustices such as racism and homophobia as well as raising awareness of climate change.   There was nothing stopping them from doing that - but there is now. The FIA has now made it illegal for any driver to protest in a way which isn't pre-approved by the governing body, in a move it says brings it in line with other major sporting organisations such as FIFA and the IOC.  That move was made official last month, but on Tuesday Ben Sulayem made it clear it will be enforced. ""You can use sport for peace reasons... But one thing we don't want is to have the FIA as a platform for private personal agenda,"" he told reporters. ""We will divert from the sport. What does the driver do best Driving. They are so good at it, and they make the business, they make the show, they are the stars. Nobody is stopping them. ""There are other platforms to express what they want. Everybody has this and they are most welcome to go through the process of the FIA, to go through that."" Such protests have upset some countries in the past. For example, Vettel's comments against a ""climate crime"" in Canada prompted a furious public response from politician Sonya Savage, who blasted the German as a ""hypocrite"". Promotion of LGBTQ+ rights in conservative Middle-Eastern countries have also caused a stir in recent years. It is not yet known if such statements would be pre-approved by the FIA - or what the exact penalty would be for a driver who ignores this new rue - though Ben Sulayem hinted he would be against such protests as he insisted this move will ""clean up"" F1. He added: ""I have my own personal things, OK, but it doesn't mean I will use the FIA to do it. The FIA should be neutral, I believe. We need the superstars in to make the sport. If there is anything, you take the permission. If not, if they make any other mistake, it's like speeding in the pit lane. If you do it, it's very clear what you get.""

26,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-01,UK NEWS; Version:1,"London flat for rent for £1,400 a month with bed tucked away in kitchen cupboard","Fancy renting a one-bed Pimlico flat for just £1,400 a month One intrepid house-hunter did until she discovered the bed was stored in the kitchen cupboard. Described by estate agents City Living London on Rightmove as a 'well-presented ground floor studio apartment', that 'comprises of a fully equipped kitchen, modern shower room and a living space with wooden flooring throughout', Rachel Kitcat's eyes lit up. And then she took a look at the images on the website and was impressed... until she saw picture number three. It showed a bed that had been unfolded from the cupboard, located in the corner of the pokey kitchen-diner, with the end of the berth nearly touching the oven door.  READ MORE:  Such was her exasperation at the sight before her, she shared her thoughts on TikTok. Rachel, from Woking, showed the first couple of pictures of the flat - actual price of £1,387 per calendar month - on her video and began by telling her followers: ""Guys, just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. ""Buying a property in London is out of the question so I'm going on the rent market now, and yes you're probably thinking 'do you know what, it's not looking half bad', it's fairly modern. ""Other side of the studio, wardrobes are fairly new, got a nice little table over here where you can eat your dinner."" After the pleasant introduction, things went sour, when image three appeared and she went on: ""Hey presto, bing bang bosh, open the wardrobe and there's your bed. ""Imagine this, you're laying here after a one-night stand. Bosh! Your bloke hits your head on the door. ""Bosh, I hit my head on the other, but fear not - if you just edge towards the end of the bed right here I can get you your fresh chicken nuggets at 4am in the morning."" She then added sarcastically: ""Well worth 1,400 quid if you ask me."" Her comedic short video has received nearly 13,000 likes and around 300 replies, one which said: ""Worst part is, the landlord will find someone to rent it at this price."" Another added: ""Who's more delusional The agents that write the descriptions or the people that actually rent places like this"" Someone else commented: ""In Cornwall you can pay that price for a five-bed house and live by the coast and better quality of life, I just avoid London now it's crazy."" One TikTok user has been to look at the flat and described what they saw: ""Me and my partner literally went and viewed this apartment last year and we were so shocked by it. It was awful! Even the bathroom is in the cupboard."" Not everyone was up in arms about the price of the flat, with one person replying: ""I mean you are looking in one of the most expensive parts of London. Literally 45 seconds away from Mayfair on the Tube."" The property is located at St Georges Drive, Pimlico in central London and was put on the market by City Living London on Friday January 27. Content editor Rachel told Deadline News: ""I was absolutely appalled that someone could be expected to pay such a price during this current climate, regardless of whether it is in London or not. ""It makes me feel sad that there are people out there willing to pay that, 80 per cent of them are awful.""

27,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-18,TV NEWS; Version:1,Love Island bosses warned over dates due to 'dangerous' seals attacking in South Africa," Love Island's upcoming beach dates could prove perilous: Cape Town residents are on high alert after a bob of toxic fish-crazed seals attacked bathers.  Producers will have to ensure their romantic breaks from the villa are a safe distance from the colony of brain-damaged animals. Experts believe the seals have become unusually aggressive after digesting a toxic acid produced by marine algae, consumed by the fish they then eat. It is blamed for a mass death among the Cape Peninsula seal population, and for leaving survivors with brain damage. The usually docile sea mammals have recently attacked an American tourist and a young boy. A spear fisherman was almost dragged into the sea by one vicious creature. A source said: ""Producers want to film romantic dates in the beautiful beaches of Cape Town, but the behaviour of the local seal population is totally unpredictable at the moment, so they need to be avoided at all costs."" The algae usually only blooms for a few weeks, but has survived longer this year, possibly due to climate change and pollution. ""The animals that survive domoic acid poisoning suffer neurological damage and we suspect that is what has led to an increase in the number of attacks,"" Brett Glasby, from the city's Two Oceans Aquarium, said.  Raised By Wolves actress Loulou Taylor is seen being pecked by the seals in a video that also shows them bite a boy's leg.   In tonight's episode of Love Island, new Bombshells Zara and David took Ron and Tanya on dates to a local vineyard. Fortunately, no seals interrupted their stunning setup.

28,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-25,MONEY; Version:1,Major energy supplier launches lowest price heat pump installation offer,"A major energy supplier has said it will guarantee the ""lowest"" price to install a heat pump. Scottish Gas, which is British Gas' Scottish division, will start its heat pump installation price at £499 but are willing to go lower if you show them a cheaper offer by an MCS-credited installer. The same offer is being given to households in England and Wales, however, the starting installation price is £2,999.  Again British Gas is willing to match the cost of another installer.  The reason why Scottish Gas offer is a lot lower is due to a £7,500 grant provided by the Scottish Government through its Home Energy Scotland scheme.  The offer for all customers applies to a standard air source heat pump up to 7Kw and a standard cylinder with a capacity of up to 200L, along with mechanical and electrical installation. The energy firm will also offer five years warranty after the installation as part of the offer.  Scottish customers, who are managed by Scottish Gas, will also be supported by the new Heat Pump Heroes team which is a new heat pump advisory service by the energy firm.  The service aims to provide further guidance to those installing heat pumps.  British Gas hopes the offers will help more people make the switch to heat pumps and lower their emissions. Overall, the energy firm has so far installed over 2,300 heat pumps  Andrew Middleton, managing director of British and Scottish Gas Net Zero said: ""Heat pumps are an essential part of the UK's journey towards a decarbonised future.  ""We recognise that many households are being cautious with their spending in the current climate and want to do all we can to make this technology more affordable -so that those customers who can make the move to low carbon heating feel compelled to do so now."" The energy firm explained that heat pump technology is ""widely recognised"" as the ""best immediate option"" for off-grid and well-insulated homes.  It also said the installation of heat pumps was ""critical"" to keep the UK ""on track"" to achieve its Net Zero target by 2050. Business and energy minister Lord Callanan said: ""We know that heat pumps are proven to be an excellent, reliable technology which help consumers to move away from fluctuating gas prices. ""With offers like this one, alongside government incentives such as slashing VAT on heat pump installation to zero, government and industry can work together in helping more homeowners to see these benefits in 2023 and beyond"".

29,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-26,TV NEWS; Version:1,Maureen Lipman bids goodbye to Coronation Street ahead of sell-out West End show," Soap actress Maureen Lipman is set to take a break from Coronation Street in order to focus on a brand new role.   The much-loved actress, 76, who plays Evelyn Plummer in the ITV soap, is heading for the stage and will perform a one woman show Rose at the West End later this year.  The stage show, called Rose, tells story of a woman who travels from Nazi-occupied Europe in order to set out on a new life in America after enduring hardship for years on end. Rose previously had sell-out runs at Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester and The Park Theatre in London, with Maureen being the latest star to take on the exciting role. Although Maureen will be leaving Coronation Street for an extended period in order to take to the stage, she will be making a return to the cobbles.  ""Maureen will be departing Corrie for Rose, she will be returning to the soap. Maureen will be taking a short break from the cobbles to star in the play,"" an insider told The Sun.  The actress has become a fan-favourite among Coronation Street fans since joining the soap back in 2018 as Evelyn, the grandmother of Tyrone Dobbs.  Corrie fans love her as a sharp-tongued battleaxe who takes no prisoners, but Maureen is far more careful about what she says off camera than her character Evelyn Plummer.  The comic actress recently told The Mirror that she finds it harder to speak her mind now because of cancel culture.  She faced an online backlash over the summer after sticking up for JK Rowling in the transgender debate, and she has warned comedy risks being 'wiped out, because too many performers are scared of offending audiences.  Maureen, 76, said: ""You can't be Evelyn in today's climate. ""You can't make jokes that I would normally make. I am watching myself carefully.  ""I am not going to be on breakfast television like someone we know telling people they can f off.  ""At the same time I am an intelligent person and I want a better world. I don't know how I identify and I am watching carefully as to how this plays out because prejudice is prejudice, however you dress it up.""

30,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-05,SCIENCE; Version:1,Met Office issues ominous weather outlook as 2022 named the hottest UK year on record," The Met Office has revealed the UK recorded an annual average temperature of more than 10C for the first time, as it confirmed 2022 as the hottest year on record.   Top meteorologists pointed toward climate change as the driving force behind the temperatures last year, which saw over 40C recorded in the country for the first time.  All of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recorded a record-breaking average temperature in 2022. Figures were also the highest on record for the Central England Temperature CET, which has been recorded since 1659. At 11.1C it is only the second time in history the record documented an average temperature above 11C. Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: ""Although an arbitrary number, the UK surpassing an annual average temperature of 10C is a notable moment in our climatological history. ""This moment comes as no surprise, since 1884 all the 10 years recording the highest annual temperature have occurred from 2003. ""It is clear from the observational record that human-induced global warming is already impacting the UK's climate."" An attribution study conducted by Met Office scientists indicated ""the UK's record-breaking annual temperature"" was now ""around 160 times more likely"". ""It is now possible to confirm that 2022 was the UK's hottest year on record, with an average temperature of over 10°C recorded for the first time,"" they said. The study suggested that in a natural climate where ""human climate influences are removed"", the temperatures seen last year would be a one-in-500-year event. Now, they said, it is likely once every three or four years. McCarthy added: ""Even with the influence of climate change we don't expect every year to be the hottest on record from now on. ""Natural variability of the UK climate means there will always be some variation year to year, however looking at longer-term trends it is easy to pick out the influence climate change is having over time."" Last year was the highest average temperature since records began in 1884 and was 0.89C above the 1991-2020 average. It was also 0.15C higher than the previous record set in 2014. Met Office Climate Attribution Scientist, Dr Nikos Christidis, said the results showed that the ""UK average temperature of 10C could occur almost every year"" by the end of the century. This is under a model of a 'medium emissions scenario' also known as 'SSP2-4.5.' This is one of five possible scenarios published by the UN climate panel report published in August 2021. In this ""middle of the road"" scenario, temperatures rise by 2.7C by the end of the century. Under the legally binding Paris Agreement adopted in 2016, plans are to try and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.

31,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-29,POLITICS; Version:2,One in 10 Ministry of Justice staff say they have experienced bullying or harassment,"More than one in 10 officials at the Ministry of Justice say they have experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination.  The department is suffering an exodus of staff as a Whitehall probe investigates bullying claims against Justice Secretary Dominic Raab.  According to the annual Civil Service People Survey, 11% of MoJ staff warned that they had experienced bullying, harassment or discrimination -significantly higher than an average across the Civil Service of 7%. Staff turnover in the MoJ's Whitehall headquarters has dramatically increased over the last year under Mr Raab's leadership. According to an annual report by the department, 7.2% of staff have left the department and civil service in the years 2021/22, compared to only 4.6% in 2020/21. The Mirror Dominic Raab nicknamed 'The Incinerator' as Deputy PM 'burns through' staff so quickly because he ""burns through"" staff so quickly. Officials working for him accused him of creating a ""climate of fear"" in the Ministry of Justice. Downing Street confirmed last month the Deputy Prime Minister was facing eight bullying complaints.  The Prime Minister has tasked lawyer Adam Tolley KC with looking into incidents during Mr Raab's stints as Justice Secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary.   Mr Raab was appointed Justice Secretary in September 2021. He was ousted from the department when Liz Truss became PM, but he returned just seven weeks later when Mr Sunak entered No10 last month.   Previous Labour analysis found that in the 12 months since Mr Raab's appointment, 963 staff quit at the department's HQ - up from 795 in 2021 and 610 two years before.  Mr Sunak came under pressure to sack Mr Raab last week when the Guardian revealed the bullying investigation was much bigger than expected, with at least two dozen complainants involved. When Mr Sunak became PM three months ago, he promised a government of ""integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level"", but repeated sleaze scandals have called this into question. Shadow Justice Secretary Steve Reed, who uncovered the figures, said: ""It is shocking to learn that staff are fleeing the bullying culture under Dominic Raab.  ""This Conservative Government has a shameful track record of brushing serious misconduct under the carpet. Their refusal to act on Priti Patel 's bullying led their ethics chief to quit in disgust.   ""Rishi Sunak promised integrity and accountability. His failure to suspend Raab while serious allegations of his bullying are investigated is yet more proof of the Prime Minister's weakness inside his own party. Labour has a plan to clean up politics through a fully independent Ethics and Integrity Commission.""  A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We have zero tolerance for bullying, harassment or discrimination and reports of this behaviour in MoJ and our agencies have fallen by around a third since 2010 as a result of our work to tackle it.""

32,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-03,MONEY; Version:1,Poundstretcher announces plan to open 50 new stores -and workers get 10% pay rise," Poundstretcher has announced its plan to open 50 new sites across the UK before the end of the year. The popular discount chain believes the new store openings could generate a further 2,000 jobs over the next five years. The discount chain opened 30 locations across the UK last year and currently has over 350 shops nationwide with over 6,000 employees.  Poundstretcher has not shared a full list of where it plans to open its new sites however, one of its new shops has already opened in Scotland last week. This new location based in Galashiels opened on January 28 offering customers 50% off selected lines.  The discount store stated that its profitability has grown since 2020 and that it is now looking towards a ""profitable future"" that will drive sales, profits and number of stores growth.   Alongside this news, Poundstretcher also announced it was to give its staff a pay rise of 10% from April 1 2023.  All members of staff who have worked for the business for at least one year will be eligible for the increase, which includes more than 70% of its workforce, around 4,000 staff, and the majority of its customer-facing employees.  On this announcement, the owner of Poundstretcher Aziz Tayub said: """"This 10% pay raise will make a real difference in this current climate to the majority of our employees who are committed to servicing our customers and growing our business in the current economic climate."" This is the second time in the last 12 months that the chain has given its staff a wage rise of 10%.  Last year it implemented a salary hike to reward staff for their hard work post-pandemic and for the positive turnaround of its profits.  In July 2020, Poundstretcher entered into a Compulsory Voluntary Arrangement CVA to find a way of offloading high rent stores.  In November last year, it chain announced it had exited the two-year CVA after repaying its creditors at a rate of 12p to the pound. Poundstretcher has now paid off around £13 million of what it owed.

If you go to Norwich vs Burnley you might take advantage of the offer of discounts on vegan pies, old merchandise and reusable items at Carrow Road. At Southampton women's game against Crystal Palace there will be free tasters of vegan food, wildflower seeds and a car sharing scheme.   Carlisle have a 'green marketplace' before their game against Harrogate. Northampton have a 'green fanzone' for the game against Walsall. Fans who head to Molineux for Wolves vs Liverpool will see the home side launch a new sustainability strategy, which will see them commit to reaching net zero by 2040.   Green Football Weekend   The initiative, called Green Football Weekend, is a big step. It will bring together the communities behind 80 professional football clubs to promote positive action against climate change.   As part of the movement, supporters are being challenged to score 'green goals' for their clubs by eating a plant-based meal, cycling instead of driving, or turning down the heating by one degree. At the time of writing, Manchester United are way out in front in pursuit of the wooden Green Football Cup.   This is undoubtedly noble work which will hopefully build on Game Zero, a match played between Tottenham and Chelsea in September 2021 which aimed to be the world's first net zero carbon football game at an elite level. But there is also an elephant in the room.   While broadcasters and the teams are fully signed up, along with the English Football League and the Women's Super League, the Green Football Weekend has not been officially endorsed by the Premier League.  Mirror Football twice approached the Premier League, hoping to speak about the organisation's sustainability goals. Both approaches were declined. A spokesperson for the Premier League did point out they have recently appointed a head of sustainability, have launched educational tools to promote environmental issues to children and included carbon reduction goals in the league's handbook. The organisation committed to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework in November 2021. It aims to cut its emissions in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 and will detail how it plans to do that by releasing an environmental strategy later this year. The past few years have seen a great deal of movement in this area, with the realisation that something needs to be done finally hitting home. But the lack of joined-up thinking across the board, between governing bodies, clubs and other outside organisations like charities and fan groups shows how much more needs to be done.  'Inexplicably slow'  As the owner of Forest Green Rovers, Dale Vince is an authority on the subject. As the world's first vegan and UN certified carbon-neutral football club, Forest Green have pushed the boundaries of what can be done.  Vince accuses Premier League clubs of being ""inexplicably slow to act"". Speaking to Mirror Football in November 2021, he insisted it would be ""so easy"" for the country's biggest clubs to follow in Rovers' footsteps. While he recognises that there has been some progress, he laments: ""Broadly not much has happened - and it would still be so easy for them to do it at a stroke. It wouldn't be a huge sum of money and they could do something meaningful. But nobody yet has.""   Liverpool and Tottenham finished joint top of the BBC 's Sustainability League last year. Liverpool announced this week that they have become the first Premier League club to be awarded the British Standards Institute certificate for sustainability. Spurs have finished top of the league for the past three years and, like the Premier League itself, have committed to halving its carbon emissions by 2030 and becoming net zero carbon by 2040.   But they are the exceptions, rather than the rule. Just four of the 20 clubs in the Premier League are signed up to the UN Sports for Climate Action initiative, with Arsenal and Southampton the other two involved, while Deloitte's annual Money League report noted that only four of the 20 richest clubs in the world were involved. It urged more to sign up and predicted ""pressure from stakeholders such as fans, partners, investors and regulators"".  Vince believes part of the problem is down to the disconnect that exists in many football clubs between those focused on football and those who are business-focused. While most clubs have well-meaning people, they are ultimately geared towards one thing: winning matches. The dichotomy was shown recently at Nottingham Forest. The club boasted about extending an agreement with energy company EON to ""raise awareness of the climate crisis"" and ""seek to play their part in a greener and more sustainable energy future"". In the same breath, they also took a 20-minute flight to an away game at Blackpool because they couldn't bear being in a coach for around three hours. ""Whether it is right or wrong, I think it is pretty normal for a team, in the Premier League particularly, and for a lot of Championship teams, to fly distances like that,"" Forest manager Steve Cooper said. ""It's probably not just a question for Nottingham Forest. It is probably a question for the whole of the Premier League. We are no outliers here. In fact, because of where we are situated in the country, we probably fly less than most.""  Grassroots pressure  Vince works with the UN on its climate action programme and advises UEFA on the topic. He believes that while the responsibility should lie with governing bodies like the Premier League, EFL and FA to mandate things from the top down, they can be forced into action from the bottom up by fan action. ""It might come from the fans, from the grassroots putting pressure on,"" he said. ""We've seen that in League Two when we were there - fans coming to our place and going back to their clubs and asking 'Why can't we have food like that' Carlisle then put on an all vegan menu when we went to play them, which was a shock. It was a great thing - and it came from fan pressure.""  The Government is Football ownership set for revolutionary shake-up that will impact multi-million buyers which calls for an independent regulator in football. While the focus is on financial sustainability, increasing fan involvement and blocking breakaway leagues, Vince believes that it could provide the perfect opportunity to implement new sustainability rules.  ""I don't think they need to enforce carbon neutrality, but as a starting point let's have minimum standards,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be difficult or even arguable to have them for recycling, bike parking, electric car charging, vegan food, single use plastics - that sort of thing. ""It's not arguable or controversial. Some clubs may complain that it's going to cost money but it costs money to run a football club and keep it safe for the fans every year. To get ground grading now costs money - and that's for public safety. But this environmental issue is about public safety, just in a different way.""  Action needed   For Barney Weston, a director at sustainability charity Football For Future, the Green Football Weekend is a great initiative which helps tackle the ""serious problem"" of low awareness about the climate crisis. He thinks that images of polar bears on melting ice caps have become cliched and football fans need to be engaged in a different way. But ultimately a clear sense of direction needs to come from the top.  ""Every club within English football should have an environmental sustainability strategy in place, alongside a date-based carbon net zero commitment,"" Weston said. ""Governing bodies need to start doing their bit to help the poorest clubs. There also needs to be more support for the most at-risk clubs. For them, it's not just a question of tackling climate change, by reducing their footprint, it's a case of adapting to climate change, for example by reducing the risk of their pitch getting flooded on a regular basis."" Green Football Weekend circumvents the polar bear cliche and will therefore hopefully use football as a platform to engage thousands of people this weekend. But its impact will be minimised if it is not used as a springboard for all parties to come together and lay out a coherent plan for the future of the game.

34,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-27,ROYALS; Version:1,Prince Harry's next appearance after memoir drama is revealed -and tickets cost $995," Prince Harry's next move after the release of his controversial memoir Spare has been revealed.  It has been announced that he will a guest speaker at a two-day summit for business leaders in the United States, with tickets for the event costing $995. Called Uplift, it is described as a ""two-day immersive summit"" where attendees will ""hear firsthand from renowned leaders, luminaries and researchers about how human transformation is key to building a thriving business today, and tomorrow"".  It will take place in San Francisco on March 7 and 8 and Harry will be appearing in his role as Chief Impact Officer at start-up BetterUp, which is hosting the event.  He is down to be a guest speaker, although it is not clear exactly what he will be speaking about.  A programme for the event says: "" Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex is a husband, father, humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate, and environmentalist.""   Others appearing at the event include BetterUp's CEO Alex Robichaux and actress Issa Rae, who appeared on Meghan Markle's Spotify podcast Archetypes.  BetterUp said: ""The immersive summit will feature the exchange of ideas and inspirational conversations delivering unparalleled insights for leaders around talent retention, growth and how to best enable managers to lead high-performing teams through the current climate of change and uncertainty. ""The event will also explore the latest trends in AI, research around resilient workforces, the intersection of wellbeing and performance, and ultimately how to foster human transformation at scale."" Harry joined BetterUp, a start-up that focuses on coaching people on their mental health to help people's performance, in March 2021. It offers custom support and services that ""strengthen mental fitness,"" with the aim of allowing customers to ""unleash personal and professional performance."" The company's chief has kept his lips sealed on how much Harry is paid for his role.  But Colin Plamondon, a US-based apps investor, previously told the Mirror the royal's star appeal to clients could bring handsome compensation of £500,000 to £2million a year ""at a minimum"" including salary and equity.  News of his latest upcoming appearance comes just over two weeks after the release of his controversial memoir Spare.  The memoir, which hit the shelves on January 10, includes claims that his brother Prince William physically attacked him and that the King put his own interests above Harry's.  The memoir is the fastest-selling non-fiction book in the UK since records began in 1998. According to Nielsen BookData, which collects and provides information on distribution and sales measurement of books, Harry's headline-grabbing autobiography Spare sold 467,183 copies in its first week. Despite the memoir hitting shelves in Spain ahead of the official publication date, and a number of extracts leaking in the lead-up to the book's UK release, Nielsen's data suggest sales were not negatively affected.

35,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-01,UK NEWS; Version:1,Protesters planned to KIDNAP King Charles Madame Tussauds waxwork and hold it hostage,"Climate protesters plotted to kidnap King Charles' waxwork from Madame Tussauds -before opting to smear cake in its face instead. Tom Johnson, 29, and Eilidh McFadden, 20, have been convicted of planning to hold the wax effigy hostage as part of ongoing Just Stop Oil protests. The pair however abandoned their plans as they thought it would be ""too frightening"", and instead slapped cake in the royal waxwork's face ""custard pie"" style in October last year. Westminster magistrates' court heard the two, both from Scotland, stood next to the waxwork and removed their clothes to reveal t-shirts bearing the group's name. Prosecutor Jonathan Bryan said they then ""made short speeches about climate change, the gallery was cleared the police were called, and when police arrived both defendants were arrested"". The cost of the cleaning and repairs to the figurines, particularly the wax model of the King cost £3,500, the bench heard. Danielle Clancy-Shelton, head of operations at Madame Tussaud's, described the aftermath of the cake attack as ""quite hysterical"". ""There was what I believed to be cake, mainly over King Charles' face and his garments. ""There was also a white foamy residue that had also gone on those two figures as well as Prince William and Princess Kate's dress and on the floor."" Johnson and McFadden claim they were acting out of necessity to raise awareness of the current climate emergency. Footage of the cake attack was shown in court with Johnson shouting: ""I will not be confronted by my grandchildren and tell them why I did not do anything to stop the poisoning of this planet."" Johnson, representing himself, told the court he was ""surprised"" the incident had escalated as far the court, adding that the disruption and damage to Madame Tussaud's owners Merlin Entertainment was ""really minor for them"". ""When we were designing the action, we considered other actions such as holding hostage the figure of King Charles III and broadcasting his own words. ""We agreed that could've been extremely disturbing or frightening to anyone on the scene, so we decided to stand next to him and calmly quote his words. ""Unfortunately, the noise level in the room was quite loud and we had to shout but the substances we used were carefully chosen to cause as little damage as possible."" Mr Bryan asked: ""Would you say King Charles has quite a good record of talking out about climate change, your action would've been better had you chosen a climate denier would it not"" Johnson replied: ""We did it largely because it was confusing and shocking."" McFadden, who is also self-representing, told the court: ""Shaving foam on a wax model is nothing compared to what we are going to see from the climate crisis."" Both Johnson, of Forneth, Blairgowrie, and McFadden, of Glasgow, denied criminal damage to a property valued under £5,000, but convicted on Wednesday by District Judge Neeta Minhas. Johnson was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £1,750 in compensation with £250 in court costs. McFadden, who has previous convictions relating to climate activism, was handed a 12-month community order with 80 hours unpaid work. She too must pay £1,750 in compensation and £250 in court costs.

36,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-12,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,Riot police evict people from village as it's demolished to make way for coal mine," Police in riot gear were called in to clear protestors from a village after demolition began to make way for a controversial new coal mine. Some stones and fireworks were thrown by activists on Wednesday morning as officers entered to fence off the tiny hamlet of Luetzerath in northwest Germany. Energy company RWE has won a contract to extract coal beneath the settlement, a move which it along with the local government claims is necessary to ensure energy security in Germany. The firm reached a deal last year that allows the village to be destroyed in return for ceasing all coal use by 2030, rather than the proposed national deadline of 2038. But the plans have been fiercely opposed by environmental activists, who claim it will result in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. A number had taken to camping out in the village -some in tree houses -before police removed barricades they had set up near the entrance of the site on Wednesday.  Officers also removed dozens of disgruntled people from an impromptu roadblock, with some leaving voluntarily while others were carried away.  One reportedly screamed in apparent pain as officers took her away. Squatters were also evicted from farm warehouse, while others braved chilly winds to stand on the roofs of Luetzerath's remaining buildings Speaking from the top-floor window of one of the houses, 53-year-old local resident Petra Mueller said she was ""really afraid"" and had been at the site for a few days. She said she would defend Luetzerath ""until nothing is left standing"", adding that hope dies last."" Protestors in the condemned village have defied a court ruling effectively banning them from the area.  On Tuesday some built dug trenches, built barricades and perched atop giant tripods in an effort to stop heavy machines from reaching the village, before police pushed them back by force. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, a member of the Green Party who is Germany's economy and climate minister, said the agreement as ""a good decision for climate protection"" that fulfils many of the environmentalists' demands and saves five other villages from demolition.   ""I think climate protection and protests need symbols but the empty hamlet of Luetzerath, where no one lives any more, is the wrong symbol from my point of view,"" Habeck told reporters in Berlin.

37,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-30,POLITICS; Version:2,"Sadiq Khan teases exciting 2040 London Olympics bid as he bigs up ""greenest Games ever""","Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has teased a possible bid to host another Olympics in the capital. He spoke on the prospect of London welcoming the world for a fortnight of sporting brilliance once again in 2040, less than 30 years after the success of 2012.  ""We're working with colleagues to get a bid explored. 2032 and 2036 are a done deal,"" the mayor told MyLondon. ""The attraction of a deal for 2040 for London is it would be the greenest Olympics ever -watch this space.""   London 2012 was received incredibly well as thousands of fans from around the world descended on English shores for the showpiece event. Plenty of new champions were crowned while megastars cemented their legacy as the greatest in their respective sports. The Mayor of London believes a potential Olympic Games could help to address some of London's long-term transport and infrastructure issues, just like London 2012, which saw big developments in the East London town of Stratford.  Khan previously stated that should London be awarded another Games, the aim would be to host the most environmentally friendly Olympics in history. The 52-year-old told Sky Sports News last July that he wanted to show the International Olympic Committee IOC and the world that a mega sporting event could be held with green credentials, with the intent to reuse many of the venues used in 2012. ""We're working on a plan to bring the Olympics back to London, and I'll tell you why,"" said Khan. ""We've seen over the last few days the consequences of climate change in relation to the heatwaves, in relation to the grass fires. ""What we need is to make sure future games are green and what we're doing is working on a plan to have the greenest games ever. The great thing about London is you don't expend carbon on building new stadiums, new places to do cycling, new places to do swimming, because we've got all the kit. And so watch this space."" The UK government is optimistic about London's chances of hosting another Games. This is due to the country's track record of hosting major sporting events, with another example as recently as last summer's excellent Commonwealth Games. ""The UK has a long and successful track record of staging major sporting events that have the power to deliver wide-ranging economic benefits,"" a UK Government source said. ""These events bring the nation together, inspire greater participation and enhance our global reputation and a future Olympic Games could do just that. We've shown the world what we can do with London 2012 with our fantastic sportsmen and sportswomen making our country proud."" During the 2012 Olympics, Team GB earned 65 medals and matched the feat at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. Should another Games take place in the London 17 years from now, a new crop of British athletes will be keen to make their mark and become national heroes.

38,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-27,FORMULA 1; Version:1,Sebastian Vettel responds to WRC rumours ahead of first race since F1 retirement," Sebastian Vettel admitted it would be ""a huge challenge"" to pursue a career in top-level rallying after his Formula 1 retirement.  The German called time on his F1 career at the end of last season. He left an incredibly legacy, not only his 53 race wins and four world championships, but also the way in which he used his global platform to highlight climate change and campaign for social justice. Given his popularity, fans were gutted to see Vettel leave F1. But they will have the chance to watch him in racing action this weekend, as he once again takes part in the Race of Champions. The annual event, which returns to a snow and ice track in northern Sweden for a second year, sees drivers from many different motorsport disciplines all compete on the same track and in equal machinery to determine who is the overall 'Champion of Champions'.  Vettel performed admirably last year, faring better than many drivers with much more off-road experience to finish as runner-up behind Sebastien Loeb. That, plus his personal enjoyment of rallying, has led to speculation that he might consider competing in the World Rally Championship.  At a press conference on Friday, the 35-year-old was asked about that prospect. While he didn't rule it out, Vettel made a point of speaking about how difficult it would be for him to adapt to a much different motorsport compared to F1. ""I have a huge admiration for rally drivers, I think it's an incredible skill,"" he said. ""This is a tiny glimpse of what it might feel like to do a rally, but it feels like I arrive with a screwdriver and a hammer - two tools - whereas they arrive with the whole toolbox. Whatever might happen, they have the right-fitting tool. ""It's a great sport. There's the racing element and the skill, but it's many different [to F1] in many ways. I think the drivers are great and I don't think they get the limelight they deserve. Rally is popular in the Nordic countries but deserves to be very popular around the world because the skill is incredible. ""The discipline as well - it's very different as a sport. So, I don't know. I think it would be a lot of work, but maybe something that, after a while, if it starts to itch... It would be very different, a huge challenge. ""I always follow it closely - not the sector split, but the rallies and the stages. There have been a lot of young kids coming up. I remember the days when Petter [Solberg] was winning and competing. It's not like I grew up with rallying, but I've always admired that people are so fast without kerbs and track limits.""

39,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-28,FORMULA 1; Version:1,Sebastian Vettel slept in the boot of his dad's camper van as he chased F1 dream," Norbert Vettel once lifted the lid on all the hard work his son Sebastian had to put in as a youngster in order to live out his Formula 1 dream.  Vettel retired from F1 at the end of last season, aged 35. He will be sorely missed by fans not only for his outstanding racing ability, but also his humour and the way in which he led by example when using his platform to highlight social injustices and climate change.  It was fitting that his father, Norbert, was there in the Aston Martin garage as the four-time world champion said farewell to the sport. Especially given how much time and effort he also put in to help his son Seb to reach the pinnacle of motorsport.   Vettel Snr once spoke, in an interview with Motorsport-Total, about what life was like for the family as they poured everything into helping Seb to live his F1 dream. ""It all really started in 1994,"" he said.  ""It would have been a mistake if we had already dreamed of Formula 1 with the eight-year-old Seb. You have to have one goal after the other. Achieve this one - and plan the next one. Otherwise everything is over. ""In addition, the whole family had to participate. We lived for Seb's career for ten years and gave up vacations."" The studious young Vettel also had his commitment to racing questions at times, as he tried to work just as had on his schoolwork as he did on honing his racecraft. Vettel Snr added: ""If we only arrived late on Friday because Seb was still at school, some fathers would ask me: 'Does your son actually want to be a professor or a racing driver' Today all envious people know the answer!"" Particularly testing were the times when money began to dry up and sponsors disappeared. ""I was fed up again, but we didn't want to give up. For years we drove through Europe in a camper van or car. Seb slept in the trunk a few times! ""I once installed an extra tank in the VW bus so that we could drive from Germany to Italy without stopping for petrol in expensive Switzerland. Seb is scary. He learns as fast as a computer programming itself. That's how he did the theory tests for trucks, private cars and motorcycles in one day!"" In the end, the hard work turned out to be worth it. Not only did Vettel make it all the way to F1, but he left the sport last year having won 53 races and four world titles - making him one of its most successful ever racers.

40,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-01,FORMULA 1; Version:1,"Sebastian Vettel warns of looming F1 ban and is ""very worried about the future"""," Formula 1 and the motorsport world must do more to become more sustainable or risk being banned, Sebastian Vettel has warned.  The German retired from the sport last year with a remarkable sporting legacy of four world titles in a row as well as 53 race victories overall. In recent years, he also made a mark through the use of his platform to campaign for greater measures to protect the environment. Last weekend, in his first racing appearance since ending his F1 career, Vettel took part in the Race of Champions. The annual event was held, for the second time, on a snow and ice track in northern Sweden, just 60km south of the Arctic Circle. Several different vehicles are used across the Nations Cup and the Race of Champions itself, all of which were either electric-powered or used 100% sustainable biofuels. As far as motorsport events go, the ROC has one of the smallest carbon footprints. Other series, including F1, have been taking steps to reduce their impact upon the environment, but Vettel feels more must be done, or motorsport will risk being banned globally.  ""I love motorsport and I'm very careful when it comes to the future,"" he told Corriere dello Sport in Sweden. ""We have young drivers, and I have children, and I think it's really a privilege to experience the world of motorsports as I have.  ""It would be a shame if this were one day banned for obvious reasons. I think that for the future, if we want to continue practicing this sport and cultivate our passion for racing, we have to think of alternatives. ""Or we can continue to do things as we are used to for another couple of years before we end up with a really big problem. So it's good to see that people are caring about that. Of course it depends on the type of racing, but the movement exists, people are considering how to create a sustainable future. ""[The ROC] is a great event, a lot of fun, and we are all enjoying the moment. It is also very nice to see [the event's president] Frederik Johnson and all his team thinking about how to have fun responsibly, talking not only about different machines, but also everything related to the organisation of the event itself.""

Downing Street insisted that the number of formal allegations against Mr Raab remained at eight, but could not rule out that each complaint includes multiple accusers. According to The Guardian, the claims actually involve a total of at least two dozen people -possibly as many as 30. It has been reported that the former Justice Secretary ""belittled and demeaned"" the civil servants and was ""very rude and aggressive"" on multiple occasions. Other alleged incidents include people being physically sick before meetings, regularly being in tears and being left feeling suicidal due to his behaviour. Officials working for Mr Raab accused him of creating a ""climate of fear"" in the Ministry of Justice.  Rishi Sunak has tasked lawyer Adam Tolley KC with looking into incidents during Mr Raab's stints as Justice Secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary.   The deputy PM was ousted from the department when Liz Truss became PM, but he returned just seven weeks later when Mr Sunak entered Number 10.  Mr Sunak promised a government of ""integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level"", but repeated sleaze scandals have called this into question.

42,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-02,TV NEWS; Version:1,The Apprentice sends home Shazia Hussain after disastrous 'sexed-up' advertising task," The Apprentice have fired their latest candidate as Lord Alan Sugar sent Shazia Hussain home. Following her departure from the series, Shazia said that Lord Sugar will 'regret his decision'.  The BBC reality show aired another episode this evening, as the remaining candidates were tasked with creating a brand for an electric bike as well as launching an advertising campaign about it. They were then asked to pitch to a panel of experts, and things quickly turned tricky for the two teams as their visions didn't quite come to light.   Last week, the teams headed to Brighton, tasked with locating some special items but without knowing exactly what they are. They had to use their skills of deduction and ask the right questions in order to secure the best price for the items. Tonight, the remaining candidates were called to Imperial College, London, where they were joined by Lord Sugar and his aides Karren Brady and Tim Campbell, and asked to work on a brand and an advert for a new electric motorbike. Speaking to the candidates, Lord Sugar said: One of the most serious issues we face is climate change. Today, people are turning to new technology to help them make greener choices. ""Your job is to come up with a marketing campaign. You need to create a name, a digital billboard and a television advert. Ultimately, I will decide whose advertising campaign is the best and who will win the task."" Talk soon turned within the teams on who would be the project manager, with Marnie Swindells fronting one team and self-confessed motorbike lover Bradley Johnson leading the other. ""These bikes are called cafe racers and I want to put forward a brand called caf-e,"" he said, as they planned to target the Generation Z market, whilst the other team looked towards the aesthetics of the bike to encourage petrol heads to make the switch to electric. Things soon turned sour for Bradley's team in the pitch with the experts, who called out the lack of riding the motorcycle in either of their adverts. ""You've missed one of the most important parts, riding the bike,"" one expert said. They also took issue with the name Zip Zap, and as Bradley turned on his team and said his original idea of Caf-E racer, the expert insisted he would prefer it much better than the name they went to. Soon Bradley and his team found themselves in the boardroom, and he decided to bring Shazia and Avi as Lord Sugar confirmed that at least one of them would be heading home. Shazia admitted her mistakes, which Lord Sugar liked, but Karren pointed out there were so many mistakes. Tim thought Bradley had made a mistake by not being on the branding team, whilst Avi was criticised by the trio for struggling with the pitch to the experts but everyone had been keen on the brand name when he came up with it.

43,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-24,POLITICS; Version:1,"Tory lawbreaking makes Britain look 'unreliable' to global allies, warns David Lammy","Tory lawbreaking is harming Britain's reputation on the world stage, David Lammy has said. The Shadow Foreign Secretary said that police fines for both Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak while in No10 -and Tory legislation that aimed to flout international law ""damages our moral authority and political credibility"". This dire record has shown the UK to be ""unreliable"" and hindered efforts to make international pacts, he told Chatham House.  He vowed to shore up Britain's ""tarnished reputation"" with international allies and build closer ties with Europe after the Brexit battles. In a speech to the foreign policy thinktank, Mr Lammy said: ""Britain's record of respect for the rule of law has become tarnished through the Overseas Operations Bill, the Internal Markets Bill, the Protocol Bill and two prime ministers fined for breaking the law. ""This record damages our moral authority and political credibility. It shows us as unreliable, making future agreements harder to reach. ""It serves the interests of those who want to weaken the rule of law. It is unbefitting of this great country."" Mr Lammy echoed the famous Vote Leave slogan, saying Britain needs to ""take back control"" of its foreign policy, in a sign of Labour's growing confidence on Brexit after years of division. He also channelled Jeremy Corbyn by saying foreign policy needs to be ""for the many not the few"". Labour would make closer cooperation with Europe a key priority in Government, he said. Mr Lammy said: ""It is time to put an end to what the Economist has called the 'magical thinking' of the Conservative Party. ""And that means, yes, recognising the damage the government's bad Brexit deal has done to our economy."" He said Labour won't reopen fractious debates about rejoining the EU's customs union and single market -which the UK left after Brexit. ""But within our red lines, there is real progress we can make to increase trade with our neighbours and deliver prosperity at home,"" he said. ""We will aim to fix the Tories bad Brexit deal to increase trade with Europe."" Challenged over Labour's Brexit stance during a Q&A session, Mr Lammy said the UK cannot continue to do the ""hokey cokey"" on this and the bitter Brexit arguments shouldn't be revisited. He wouldn't be pinned down on whether Labour would restore the commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid for the world's poorest. The Tories broke their 2019 manifesto commitment to keep foreign aid spending locked in at this level -and merged the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development to the fury of diplomats. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the UK's spend would stay at 0.5% until 2028 in the Autumn Statement. Mr Lammy said it would be irresponsible to set out Labour's spending plans ahead of the next election as the economic climate is ""too turbulent"".

44,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-05,UK & IRELAND; Version:1,UK to get huge new indoor ski resort as climate change melts Alps snow," Winter sports fans frozen out of skiing by the melting Alps may soon be able to look a little closer to home for some action.   Plans have been hatched to construct a £300million ""world class"" resort including an indoor ski slope built into the hills and a water park in Wales.  It will have Britain's biggest indoor ski runs and be one of the biggest of its kind in the world, with one run 400m long.  The run at the Milton Keynes Snowdome is 170m, as way of comparison.  A 575-acre site south of the Brecons Beacons National Park -less than three hours drive from London and Birmingham -has been earmarked for the plans which include building three hotels and 30 woodland lodges. Bosses say the Rhydycar West scheme in Merthyr Tydfil will create at least 500 jobs in an area which has historically faced mass unemployment and could create up to 800 jobs. Chief operating officer Richard Arnold said plans are likely to be submitted later this month.  They will be examined during a turbulent year for the traditional ski industry in Europe, which has been decimated by unseasonably hot weather.  ""We wanted to get it in before Christmas so it would be a talking point. The legal review of the planning application showed no major issues, but there were small details that came up, so it has now been revised for the end of January,"" Mr Arnold said. ""We're at a point now where 80% of all the aspects of planning are complete."" Mr Arnold said the proposed 400m long indoor slope was being planned with winter sports experts. He said: ""We've collaborated with Snowsports Wales and Team GB is in favour of the project. It will be the longest in the UK and the objective is to make it the UK Centre of Snowsport Excellence because that's where Team GB will bring their athletes in the summer months and for progressive training. ""It will be approved by the Federation of International Skiing so there will be international competitions. There is a full-size board park inside it too. It's a completely new ball game. ""It's conceivable -we like to think -that having these world-class facilities on the back door of Merthyr, it's only a matter of years before somebody from Merthyr will be a winter sports medal winner."" ""We want to be a base camp for the uniqueness of the Welsh valleys area and there's no better place. ""We want to create that guarantee that will make people want to come and engage and stay longer -many trips here are one day trips or short trips. ""The real jobs are in the hands of local entrepreneurs to seize the opportunity and bring footfall into the town restaurants -we want the clientele to be roaming into the valleys having great accommodation. If the weather isn't good, they've always got something to do."" Mr Arnold said that once the plans are submitted it should take up to 16 weeks for Merthyr Tydfil County Council to give a decision. However the scheme is likely to be called in by the Welsh Government who could then take up to a year to give an approval. If given the green light, the project is estimated to take two-and-a-half-years to complete.

45,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-21,POLITICS; Version:1,"Under-fire Nadhim Zahawi racked up £1,000 limousine bill in one day at Cop26 summit","Under-fire Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi racked up a £1,040 limousine bill on a single day, while lecturing Britain about Climate Change. Mr Zahawi made headlines this week for finally settling his mammoth tax bill following a row with HMRC. But in December 2021 he charged an enormous bill to the taxpayer for chauffeur-driven limos to ferry him around Glasgow. Then Education Secretary, Mr Zahawi was visiting Scotland for the COP26 conference and gave a speech pledging to put climate change ""at the heart of education"". The same day, he visited the conference floor and was snapped meeting with Tory-supporting outdoorsman Bear Grylls. Schools minister Nick Gibb confirmed the payment was made on a government procurement card to limo firm TBR Global Chauffeuring, and charged to the Department for Education.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question from Labour 's Emily Thornberry, he said the firm ""provided transfer services between events within Glasgow when the former Secretary of State attended COP26.""  TBR offers a range of luxury vehicles made by Mercedes and Range Rover, none of which are electric. Speaking at the conference, Mr Zahawi said: ""We want to deliver a better, safer, greener world for future generations of young people and education is one of our key weapons in the fight against climate change."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""The Department used the security-cleared transport company that was recommended by the COP26 Unit, to cater for his programme and the security requirements of the venue, which were high given the plethora of world leaders in attendance as Britain led the world in the fight against climate change."" The Tory chairman today admitted to 'careless' error as he broke his silence on the row over a multimillion-pound tax settlement.  Rishi Sunak has been under pressure to sack the former Chancellor since it was reported that he paid HM Revenue & Customs a seven-figure sum to end a dispute.   Even deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab wouldn't say whether Mr Zahawi would still have his job in a month.  Asked by Sky News if Mr Zahawi will still be in his post in a month, Mr Raab said: ""A month's a long time in politics. I certainly hope so."" Mr Zahawi this morning released a statement to ""address some of the confusion about my finances"". He said: ""As a senior politician I know that scrutiny and propriety are important parts of public life. Twenty-two years ago I co-founded a company called YouGov. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved. It is an amazing business that has employed thousands of people and provides a world-beating service. ""When we set it up, I didn't have the money or the expertise to go it alone. So I asked my father to help. In the process, he took founder shares in the business in exchange for some capital and his invaluable guidance. Twenty one years later, when I was being appointed chancellor of the exchequer, questions were being raised about my tax affairs. I discussed this with the Cabinet Office at the time. ""Following discussions with HMRC, they agreed that my father was entitled to founder shares in YouGov, though they disagreed about the exact allocation. They concluded that this was a 'careless and not deliberate' error. ""So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do. ""Additionally, HMRC agreed with my accountants that I have never set up an offshore structure, including Balshore Investments, and that I am not the beneficiary of Balshore Investments. This matter was resolved prior to my appointments as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and subsequently chairman of the party I love so much.

46,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-29,WEIRD NEWS; Version:1,Unsettling footage showing meat spasming -turning carnivores into vegetarians,"An 'unsettling' video is currently doing the rounds on social media of a butcher showing freshly cut meat leaving some viewers to claim they would change their diet after watching the clip. The resurfaced video, which has recently gained over 430,000 views since it was reshared on Twitter on January 10, shows a slab of meat erupting into spasms after being coated in salt, making it look as though it were still alive. The video was recently posted online via the Twitter account @weirdterrifying and users took to the comments to discuss the twitching meat. In the clip, the anonymous butcher is seen holding the meat up to the camera so viewers could see the surface of the meat, which looked like it was pulsating as it reacted to being covered in salt. Salting meat is a crucial step used to draw out water and helps to preserve it in order to keep it fresher for longer while seasoning the meat. However, viewers were noticeably taken aback by the nine-second clip and the sight of the meat twitching. One user wrote: ""I could have done without this knowledge..."" Another added: ""Well, this could make me give up eating meat."" A third said: ""Planning a vegetarian diet from now on. That's horrible!"" A fourth declared: ""I'm going vegan."" Experts have since weighed in on the video, which originally went viral on Facebook in 2020, and say it only happens with the freshest of meats. Lv Suwen, an expert in the Philippines animal health department said at the time: ""You can rest assured, this piece of meat is very fresh and is from a freshly slaughtered animal. ""The central nervous system is dead but the nerve-endings in the muscles are still firing resulting in the jumping, because the nerves are not yet dead. This will stop after a short time."" The resurfacing of the video comes just two months after food tech company Eat Just showcased a new version of its GOOD Meat ""lab cultured chicken"" for the first time at the COP27 climate conference. Delegates at the conference nibbled on chicken satay without a single chicken being killed as part of GOOD Meat's mission for people to eat meat without costing a life.

47,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-24,TRAVEL NEWS; Version:3,Wedding planner tips for destination weddings including choosing the 'right time',"A wedding planner to the stars has revealed the main do's and don'ts all couples should note if they're planning a celebration abroad.  Liz Taylor, CEO of wedding and event planners the Taylor Lynn Corporation, has helped the likes of Gary Neville, Michelle Keegan and Mark Wright with their big days.  She's also helped organise nuptials in Venetian palaces, stately homes, chateaus, boutique hotels, marquees, nightclubs and mountain retreats, across a host of destinations around the world.  Liz shared some of the tricks of the trade with the Mirror after the tale of one particular destination wedding gone wrong began circulating online.  The story, which was posted on Reddit, was about a woman's destination wedding on an island resort which got ""WAY out of hand in terms of both cost and time commitment"", according to her sister.  For most guests the 12 hour flight would cost £800, the trip would require taking a week off work, and the cheapest rooms were £750. When guests started to back out -including two bridesmaids -the bride shared her disappointment with her sister.  Her concerned sibling said she ""took it upon myself to be the one to tell her things were getting out of hand"". Unfortunately, her gentle suggestions that the wedding was too expensive ""did not go over well."" ""She completely blew up at me, accused me of ruining her dream wedding and hung up on me,"" the sister continued. ""My mum and aunt called me later on to tell me I was out of line, but I don't think I was. ""My sister is used to always getting what she wants, but she's burning friendships over this wedding and the way things are going it might end up only being immediate family that comes anyway."" According to Liz, the bride made the first and most common mistake -trying to please everyone. ""You can't. In choosing to get married away from your family, there will inevitably be people who cannot attend,"" Liz said.  ""My advice. Keep it intimate and invite closest family and friends, being honest with everyone that you have chosen to keep the wedding small.  ""Then invest in a fabulous party when you get home and have a wedding blessing. Invite all those that couldn't attend the destination event."" Another big mistake would-be happy couples make is forgetting that a wedding is a legal ceremony and that it often requires a lot of paperwork. ""It is easy to marry in some places, like Las Vegas, but in others, like Vietnam or Cambodia, the requirements and paperwork can be more difficult,"" she continued.  ""In some countries it is often easier to do the legal part at home in the UK and then have a ceremony, with vows, at your dream destination."" In the past year Liz has seen a 30% increase in people wanting to get married abroad, with the lockdowns seemingly having convinced people to ""be a bit more adventurous and quirkier with the venue and location."" The big destinations for Brits are Spain, the south of France, Barbados and the most popular of all, Majorca.  ""With UK prices increasing so dramatically, it really is comparable in price to be married abroad. And you get the beach backdrop and great weather,"" Liz noted. Check out Liz's top tips below to make sure everything goes off without a hitch...   Leave enough time  Booking the wedding at least 12 months ahead is my advice, making sure you have wedding and travel insurances in place. That gives you time to visit the destination in person, which I strongly advise. You can't plan this over zoom.  Choose the right time of the year  When the wedding takes place is a matter of personal choice, UK winter is always popular for those preferring sunnier climates.  You must check local weather before you decide though, as the last thing you want it to overheat on the beach or freeze at your mountain top destination.  Consider local customs  Always do your research. For example, there are still some countries that do not allow same sex weddings.  Think about extending your trip  It's usual when family and friends travel to see you take your vows in the location of your dreams, that they too holiday for a week or so and soak up the atmosphere.  To get some private time alone you might think about staying on longer or taking another week's holiday together.  Pack wisely  When it comes to packing, there are a few non-negotiable factors -including mosquito spray.  So many guests forget this that I now provide it alongside sun cream, blister plasters, a fan and facial spritz in a lovely welcome pack for my guests. People get so carried away with the wedding element, that they forget all the practical things.  Also, pack to the season, so if it's a hot climate throw win some lovely flip flops and a sun hat for the evening or for a beach wedding.  Cooler climate, think layers and take a pashmina or shrug that you can add to your outfit as the temperature falls.

48,mirror.co.uk,2023-01-28,NEWS; Version:1,Why Reading's shirt sleeves feature unique stripes for Man Utd FA Cup clash explained," The eyes of the footballing world are on Reading for their FA Cup meeting with Manchester United, allowing the Royals to draw attention to the campaign around their shirt sleeves.   It is the third time the two sides have met in the competition in the decade since Reading were relegated from the Premier League. United won both of the last two clashes, 4-0 in 2017 and 2-0 in 2019.   Reading have been wearing their usual blue and white hoops this season, but the red and blue striped sleeves are a new addition. It's part of a campaign aimed at raising awareness of climate change, and partners with the University of Reading have provided more details.   ""Created at The University of Reading by Professor Ed Hawkins, the #climatestripes use accurate data to show the rise in average temperatures over the past 150 years,"" the university explained on Twitter. ""Blue stripes show colder than average years, red stripes show hotter. They warn that the world is getting warmer.  ""This season, Reading FC wanted to tackle their environmental impact and called on us as one of the UK's greenest Unis. We worked with them on a 10-point sustainability plan. But, they wanted to raise awareness even further. Cue, a novel kit launch. ""The famous blue and white hoops were complemented by a bespoke set of warming stripes for Berkshire. It's the greenest shirt the club has ever produced."" The kit is made 100 per cent from recycled bottles and is recyclable itself.  ""The climate stripes are intended to start conversations about climate change -and making them visible to thousands of football fans across the country every week brings that to a new audience,"" professor Hawkins said in July. ""We hope Reading Football Club's fans will push them on to success this season, while at the same time, the players and the club will be supporting climate action and recognising the science.""   Does football do enough to fight climate change Have your say in the comments section   Ahead of the game at Old Trafford, Reading boss Paul Ince has praised opposite number Erik ten Hag. England international midfielder Ince spent several years with United as a player, winning two Premier League titles with the club.  ""With previous Manchester United sides, I just sensed that teams went to Old Trafford believing they could get something,"" the 55-year-old said. ""But what Ten Hag is doing now is giving his team a presence, and they are tougher than they have been for four or five years. ""Were they a soft touch Probably, yeah. But I sense that he's building something now. ""For a club like Manchester United not to win anything for six years cannot be right.

49,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-04,NEWS; Version:1,Why Wolves are wearing green armbands versus Liverpool in Premier League first," Wolves will make Premier League history on Saturday afternoon by wearing green armbands in their fixture against Liverpool.  The Midlanders welcome the Reds to Molineux for a 3pm kick-off aiming to continue their upwards trajectory under Unai Emery. Wolves have shown some improvement on the pitch under the Spaniard since he replaced Steven Gerrard at the start of November but they remain 17th in the table, the same position they were in when their last manager was sacked.  Their opponents this weekend, Liverpool, have had similarly mixed results since the turn of the year and their hopes of a top-four finish are already alarmingly faint. Jurgen Klopp's side are 10 points behind resurgent Manchester United, albeit with a game in hand, and need to pick up all three points against Wolves -who will be dressed differently from usual on Saturday. That is because the Molineux club have chosen to wear green armbands to support an environmental awareness project, namely Green Football Weekend. The initiative aims to draw attention to football's role in the climate crisis and how the beautiful game can pioneer sustainability. Wolves' special outfit choice as they take on Liverpool comes after they announced they are aiming to be net-zero by 2040, meaning they would be entirely negating the greenhouse gases they produce within the next two decades. Molineux, Wolves' home since 1889, has already been adapted so it is supplied solely by renewable energy. Wolves goalkeeper Dan Bentley -who joined from Bristol City during the recently-closed January transfer window -spoke of his pride at taking the lead in raising awareness on the subject as he became an ambassador for the club's One Pack, One Planet project. ""Climate change, and how we can tackle it, is one of the most important conversations we can be having at this time, and I am really pleased Wolves are playing their part by launching One Pack, One Planet,"" Bentley said.  Does football do enough to raise awareness about the climate crisis Have your say in the comments!  ""Sometimes climate change can feel overwhelming, but if we all make small changes in our lives and contribute to help the future of the planet in little ways, over time it will make a big difference.

50,mirror.co.uk,2023-02-03,MONEY; Version:1,You could be paying £250 more for your energy due to obscure rule -how to check,"The average home in the UK is paying £250 more for their electricity bill than they should because of one little-known energy industry rule.  Under existing rules, energy suppliers pay the highest price for wholesale electricity no matter how it is made. According to the climate non-profit group Carbon Tracker Initiative CTI, this quirk in determining the price means UK households overpaid by up to £7.2billion throughout 2021 and 2022. A report released by the group this week explained how the for electricity by supply companies such as Eon, OVO and SSE is determined by the result of a bidding process and generators impose the highest bid on all, regardless of how the electricity is produced.  This price is then passed on to household electricity bills. Initially, electricity prices were linked to gas-powered generation because it was the cheapest, but this is no longer the case. Gas-fired power stations are the most expensive way to generate electricity, but only makeup around 40% of all electricity used by UK homes according to the CTI.  This is due to the development of more efficient nuclear energy, the harnessing of renewable energies, and rising gas prices.  The think tank said if the ""average price"" was used instead, then around £250 could be saved per household in the UK.  Predictions by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy BEIS estimate that the cost of gas turbines could be £85 per megawatt-hour MWh of electricity generated in 2025.  Compared to this, offshore wind is expected to cost significantly less at around £57/MWh and onshore wind at £46/MWh. Solar power is predicted to cost around £44/MWh and nuclear energy is expected to cost around £73/MWh. However, according to the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy BEIS when it's windy and sunny enough to meet the demand for electricity through renewables, the wholesale cost drops to close to zero. The current system has also meant that renewable energy companies have had to sell electricity at prices far higher than it costs to produce it.  The Government has announced a ""major review"" into the UK's electricity market and will look at ways of reducing the cost for consumers in the long term.  BEIS has also announced a consultation on changes to the wholesale electricity market which will aim to stop gas prices from setting the price of electricity that is produced by cheaper renewables.
